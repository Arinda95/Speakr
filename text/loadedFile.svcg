About the Author ..........................................................300viHarry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldForeword to the 2004 EditionThis book was first published in 1973. The hardcover edition fell out of print in theearly 1980s, and the paperback version went out of print around 1990. After that iswas available only through used book dealers.So I was very pleased when LiamWorks published a new edition in 1997.After rereading the original edition, I was happy to see that the book stillreflected my view of how the world works and the principles that guide my actions.By and large I resisted the temptation to tinker with the text for the 1997, and Iagain resist that temptation in 2004. I know from experience that any attempt tomake changes would have led to my writing a whole new book. And that isnt how Iwant to spend the next few years of my life.I corrected some grammatical flaws, and I rewrote a few phrases that seemedambiguous. I also eliminated references to books and other sources that are no longeravailable. And in 1997 I replaced the Recommended Reading section with a new listprepared by Michael Cloud. It contains books available now that provide additionalinsights and strategies related to the ideas presented in this book.But the rest of the words remain as they were in the first edition. I haventrewritten the examples to make them more contemporary, nor have I adjusted anymoney amounts for the intervening years of inflation. And I didnt change words toconform with todays fashions; thus I still use he to refer to someone who could beof either sex.The books only new element is an Afterword that updates my thinking on somesubjects.So this is essentially the same book published in 1973. I happily stand by it. And I hopeyou enjoy itFreedom in an Unfree WorldviiPrologue11Freedom in an Unfree WorldFreedom is the opportunity to live your life as you want to live it.The urge for freedom is so much a part of human nature that it can never besuppressed by laws, slogans, or commandments. There is a difference, however,between the urge and the reality.For most people, freedom remains a pleasant fantasy  something to dream ofwhile carrying out daily obligations in the real world. They spend their lives talkingvaguely of what they want in life, what they think theyre missing, why they donthave it, and who it is that prevents them from being free.For most people, freedom is an if only. If only it hadnt been for my wife, I wouldhave been a success. Or If only it hadnt been for Roosevelt (or Nixon orwhomever), the country would be free.The unfree person can never fully repress his urge for freedom  whether heconsiders his jailer to be his family, his job, society, or the government. And so, fromtime to time, halfhearted attempts are made to break free from the restrictions.But unfortunately, those attempts usually depend upon the individuals ability tochange the minds of other people  and so optimism eventually turns into frustrationand despair.Hoping to be free, many people engage in continual social combat  joiningmovements, urging political action, writing letters to editors and Congressmen, tryingto educate people. They hope that someday it will all prove to have been worthwhile.But as the years go by they see little overall change. Small victories are won; defeatsset them back. The world seems to continue on its path to wherever its going. Untilthey die, the hopeful remain just as enslaved as theyve always been.The plans, the movements, the crusades  none of these things has worked. Andso the unfree person continues to dream, to condemn, and to remain where he is.There must be a better way.There must be a way to be free without having to wish for a miracle. It must be away by which an individual can change things without having to rally the rest of theworld to his side.2It has to be a way through which he can get rid of exorbitant taxes, have the timeto do what he wants to do, enjoy love without tiresome complications, removeirritating social restrictions, and free himself from the hundred and one burdens thatothers daily hand him.And it must be a way that doesnt require that he re-educate all the other peopleinvolved.Fortunately, there is such a way.It isnt necessary to join a massive campaign to reconstruct the society in whichyou live, nor do you have to patiently re-educate everyone you deal with.Theres a way that depends entirely upon what you choose to do. You can be freewithout changing the world. You can live your life as you want to live it  no matterwhat others decide to do with their lives.Is It Possible?If that doesnt seem possible, Im not surprised.After all, how can you live as you want to live when there are so many peoplewho wont let you?How can you spend your money as you please when the government takes so muchof it in taxes? How can you do what you want to do when the government and societyhave prohibited many of the things youd like to do?How could you live your own life when you have responsibilities to your family,your friends, your job? How could you possibly ignore the demands that others makeupon you?I realize that the odds against a free life must seem pretty formidable right now.And yet there are already individuals who live their lives as they choose. Some ofthem may have begun with greater problems than you face now. But in spite of theirproblems, theyve found freedom without waiting for the world to be free.To be free in an unfree world isnt nearly as unrealistic as it might seem atfirst glance. After all, its commonly assumed that there can be free nations ina world that contains enslaved nations. Why, then, cant there be free stateswithin a nation that isnt free? Or free towns within an unfree state?Most important, why cant there be free individuals within unfree towns,states, or nations?Freedom is possible, and you can have it  if thats what you really want.Freedom in an Unfree World3I cant know which specific freedom you crave most  freedom from socialrestrictions, family problems, high taxes, bad relationships, the treadmill,governmental repression. Whichever one is most important to you, well cover it andmore. And I think youll find that the principles to be stated will apply to any type ofsituation that may be restraining you.Its not likely that youll ever gain your freedom by joining, marching, picketing,or complaining  because all those methods rely upon changing the attitudes ofothers. What I have in mind concerns the use of methods over which you have completecontrol.Why You Are Not FreeFreedom is the opportunity to live your life as you want to live it. And that ispossible, even if others remain as they are.If youre not free now, it might be because youve been preoccupied with thepeople or institutions that you feel have restrained your freedom. I dont expect you tostop worrying about them merely because I suggest that you do.I do hope to show you, though, that those people and institutions are relativelypowerless to stop you  once you decide how you will achieve your freedom. Thereare things you can do to be free, and if you turn your attention to those things, no onewill stand in your way. But when you become preoccupied with those who areblocking you, you overlook the many alternatives you could use to bypass them.The freedom you seek is already available to you, but it has gone unnoticed.There probably are two basic reasons you havent taken advantage of that freedom.One reason is that youre unaware of the many alternatives available to you.You dont have to go to jail to avoid exorbitant taxes. Nor do you have to be a socialleper if you refuse to knuckle under to social pressure. You dont have to give up love inorder to avoid complicated, restrictive family problems. And you dont have to gowithout friends to avoid having your life at the disposal of others.But if youre unaware of additional alternatives, its easy to see these matters as beingeither/or questions. Fortunately, there are additional alternatives  ways by whichyou can have what you want without bringing bad consequences upon yourself.The second reason youre not free is because youve probably accepted withoutchallenge certain assumptions that restrict your freedom.4Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldOur culture is saturated with philosophical truths that are commonly acceptedand acted upon  and are rarely challenged. I think of these truisms as traps.A typical example of a trap is, It would be selfish to be concerned with your ownfreedom; you must think of others first. Or The kind of freedom you want is immoral,or The government is more powerful than you are, or You have to accept the willof the majority.There are probably hundreds of such traps, but Ive reduced those Ive seen tofourteen basic types.Its very easy to get caught in a trap. The truisms are repeated so often they canbe taken for granted. And that can lead to acting upon the suggestions implied inthem  resulting in wasted time, fighting inappropriate battles, and attempting to dothe impossible.Traps can lead you to accept restrictions upon your life that have nothing to dowith you. You can unwittingly pay taxes you dont have to pay, abide by standardsthat are unsuited to you, put up with problems that arent really yours.Traps are assumptions that are accepted without challenge. As long as they gounchallenged, they can keep you enslaved. Thats why its important that wechallenge them in the following pages. I think youll find that most of them have nomore substance than ancient clichs such as The world is flat.If youre not free now, its very likely that youve accepted some of these traps.And you probably havent known of a number of alternatives that could get you outof your restrictions without the pain and effort you might have assumed would benecessary.As we look at these traps and alternatives, I hope youll become aware of theunlimited number of avenues open to you. You possess a tremendous amount ofcontrol over your situation  control thats disregarded when you focus attentionupon the people who seem to stand in your way.Your FreedomMost books dealing with freedom present an involved plan that depends upon thesupport of other people. These usually urge you to pass the book on to others, sellthe idea to a great many people, and gain the support of the public in order to be free.This isnt that kind of book. If you were holding the only copy of it, and if no oneelse could read it or accept its conclusions, the ideas would still be useful to you.Freedom in an Unfree World5Well be dealing only with your freedom. Whether the ideas would work for others isunimportant; what you have to decide is whether they can work for you.You wont have to convince anyone else of anything. Every idea in the book willdepend solely upon your own action.I can assure you that I didnt achieve my freedom through long hours, articulateoratory, or mysterious powers of persuasion. And yet I am free.More than for any other reason, Im free because Ive chosen to live that way.Ive concentrated upon the things I control, and used that control to remove therestrictions and complications from my life.As a result, Im now free to live my life as I want to live it. Despite all-time hightaxes, I pay ridiculously few taxes. Despite my irregular life style, I live my own lifewithout interference from society.Every day of my life is mine to use as I see fit. My time isnt committed to thestate, to society, to a treadmill, or to fruitless relationships with people with whom Ihave nothing in common. I have no fear that the phone will ring any moment to tell meof something new I must do with my time.I havent needed to hide my head in the sand to achieve this. I have valuablerelationships  personal, professional, and romantic. I make far more money nowthan I did when I was restricted  and it takes far fewer hours to make it.Im involved with people who add to my life, and Im independent of those whowould take from it.My life is of little importance to you, however, and this book is not anautobiography. The title was chosen to let you know that at least one person hasaccomplished the freedom you seek, and that it can be done without changing thenature of the world. The attention will be devoted to your freedom  but the principlesand ideas presented will be those that brought freedom to me.In the process, its important to recognize that you will make all the decisionsyourself. I cant tell you how to live, nor can I tell you what you must do to be free.Instead, I can suggest dozens of opportunities from which you can choose. And I canpoint out the various traps that may be enslaving you now.You will then have to decide for yourself how youll use these suggestions. If thefinal decisions arent made by you, you could never act with the conviction and purposenecessary to achieve your objectives. You have to decide what youre going to doand, above all, you have to know why youre doing it. Otherwise, plans and hopes aremeaningless, temporary resolutions  to be shelved the first time anything happens tointerfere.So please dont gain the impression that Im telling you how to live. You have todecide how youre going to live. There will be scores of suggestions made in thisbook  and youll have to decide which ones you can accept and can act upon. If Iwrite with passion and urgency in places, dont assume that6Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIm demanding a specific course of action from you; the greatest urgency will be inencouraging you to make the decisions for yourself.Let Us BeginIn the first section well look at the numerous traps that enslave people, themultitude of assumptions that people accept without challenge, the many restrictionsupon ones life that need not exist. Its interesting to see how empty are many of thoseassumptions when looked at closely. At the end of that section, I hope it will be obviousto you why you arent free now.The second section will offer specific alternatives  ways of being free of thethings that may be enslaving you, whether they be government, bad relationships,social restrictions, the treadmill, family problems, whatever.The third section will include techniques that can be used to make the changeoverfrom a non-free life to a free life. There are numerous ways to release yourself fromthe complicated problems that seem to demand that you remain in permanentbondage.But we must keep things in their proper sequence; otherwise, the techniques willbe useless. Until you know why youre enslaved and what you have to work with, thealternatives will offer little help.It all begins with you, because youre the person who has to make you free. So itwould serve little purpose to construct an image of an ideal person and hope to makeyou conform to that image. My suggestions can work only within the context of whoyou are and what youre capable of doing.Freedom is the opportunity to live your life as you want to live it.Most of the rest of the world will remain unfree during the rest of your life. Mostpeople will continue to lead what Thoreau called lives of quiet desperation1 paying high taxes, bowing to social pressures, working longFreedom in an Unfree World71Walden by Henry David Thoreau, page 22.hours with little to show for them, never having the time to do what they want to do,resigning themselves to loveless compromises that masquerade as marriages.Fortunately, that doesnt have to be your life.Even in an unfree world, you can be free.What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free andown no superior? Walt WhitmanIt is not recognized in the full amplitude of the word that all freedomis essentially self-liberation  that I can have only so muchfreedom as I procure for myself by my ownness. Max Stirner8Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldPart I9Why You Are Not Free2The Identity TrapsThere are two Identity Traps: (1) the belief that you should be someone otherthan yourself; and (2) the assumption that others will do things in the way you would.These are the basic traps, of which many others are variations. In the first trap,you necessarily forfeit your freedom by requiring yourself to live in a stereotyped,predetermined way that doesnt consider your own desires, feelings, and objectives.The second trap is more subtle but just as harmful to your freedom. When youexpect someone to have the same ideas, attitudes, and feelings you have, you expect himto act in ways that arent in keeping with his nature. As a result, youll expect andhope that people will do things theyre not capable of doing.Who Are You?Lets begin by recognizing what we know about you.We know you are different. Youre different from everyone else in the world.Just as no two persons fingerprints are identical, no two people are identical in termsof their knowledge, understanding, attitudes, likes, and dislikes.Your knowledge is the result of your experiences  what youve done and seenand heard, where youve been, who youve known, and what youve learned fromthem. No one else has lived that life and experienced all the same things.Your ways of interpreting what you see are also unique. What you consider to belogic or common sense will vary in some way from another persons logic.As a result, you see and interpret and react to what goes on around youdifferently from anyone else.Thats not hard to see. And yet the root of the identity problem is that mostindividuals are oblivious to these differences. They assume that all people want thesame things  or that they should want them. They expect everyone to10respond in the same way to the same things. They assume that what one person orelite group sees and accepts should be accepted by everyone.This can range from one person expecting another to enjoy the movie he enjoys tothe individual whos upset if everyone doesnt go to church.All individuals are different. Each one has his own identity  with his ownknowledge, understanding, perception, and attitudes. Youre in the Identity Trapwhen you overlook these differences  and that can get in the way of your freedom.You are you and only you. You live in a world of your own, composed of yourown experience. You cant be someone other than who you are.ConsequencesWhat else do we know about you?We know that you act in ways you think will bring particular consequences toyou. You eat a sandwich because you expect it to taste good or to relieve the hungerin your stomach. You work in order to be paid money you can spend, or because youenjoy the work. You turn the ignition key in your car in order to start the engine.In some cases, you carefully think out your actions. In other cases, you act fromhabit; you rely upon previous experiences and assume that a given action will producethe desired effect.In every case, however, youre acting in ways you think will bring you theconsequences you want. And you avoid doing things you think could bringconsequences you dont like.IdentitiesAs you do this, you recognize the identity of each thing you deal with; you use it ina way thats consistent with its nature.For example, a stone is called a stone because of certain characteristics thatdistinguish it from what we call a peanut-butter sandwich. You cant eat a stone; but,because of what it is, you can use it to build something. In the same way, you cantswim in a tree, but you can use the tree for shade or for firewood.To get what you want, you determine the nature of the things you must deal with.Certain things can produce certain effects and no others  thats outside yourcontrol. What you do control is your choice of things that will be the appropriatemeans to the end you seek.The Identity Traps11A human being has characteristics that distinguish him from a stone or a tree or asandwich. So you dont expect a human being to be a stone or anything else.And just as each stone is different from every other stone, so are human beingsdifferent from one another. You have to recognize those differences in order to be ableto deal with people in ways that will bring you the consequences you want.Each person will act in keeping with his own identity. This means hell be boundby the limits of his own knowledge and experience  even if he wishes he werent.To expect him to act otherwise is to fall into the Identity Trap and hope for somethingthat cant be.You cant entrust your investments to an individual who knows nothing aboutmoney. You cant expect a knowledge of chemistry to be used by someone whos neverseen a test tube.Neither can you assume that someone will do what youve decided is right.Youve decided it from your unique knowledge and interpretations; he acts from hisknowledge and his interpretations.Youre in the Identity Trap when you assume an individual will react to somethingas you would react or as youve seen someone else react.You could make everyone else be, act, and think in ways of your choosing if you wereGod. But you arent. So its far more useful to recognize and accept each person ashe is  and then deal with him accordingly.You cant control the natures of other people, but you can control how youlldeal with them. And you can also control the extent and manner in which youll beinvolved with them.The paradox is that you have tremendous control over your life, but yougive up that control when you try to control others. For the only way youcan control others is to recognize their natures and do what is necessary toevoke the desired reactions from those natures. Thus your actions arecontrolled by the requirements involved when you attempt to controlsomeone else.Everything you do will produce an effect or consequence of some kind. Theconsequences you get will depend upon the identities of things and people and howyou deal with them. To be able to foresee those consequences depends upon your abilityto perceive the true identities of things and people.TruthSo the factor of truth becomes important. You want to see things truly so thatyou can deal with them properly. Whenever you fail to see something as it is, youll expecta result from it thats different from what will occur.12Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldSometimes a thing turns out to be different from what youd thought it was. Acomparison of the first impression with later impressions can show that the earlierview was insufficient and somehow distorted. So in terms of possible later discovery,all current knowledge is incomplete, or will be enlarged later.You can see this easily with regard to people you meet. Your first impressionmay be generally correct, but it often proves later to have been superficial orincomplete. And as a result of later knowledge, you sometimes change your ways ofdealing with them.In addition, you dont have the time to discover everything that might be relevantabout a given situation. You have to make assumptions. And that can lead to readinginto things what you expect to find. You can be so sure something is going to be acertain way that you dont notice that it isnt.For many reasons, your perception wont always be accurate. And as youinterpret what you see, your logic may not always be flawless; you might not draw allthe proper connections.This means you view things subjectively 2  colored by your own uniqueperception and interpretation. And other people view things just as subjectively.Not surprisingly, arguments develop over the truth of a given situation, sinceeach person sees things in his own unique way. Very often, however, those argumentsmiss the point. Truth isnt an end in itself. Its always a means to an end.The purpose of knowing truth is to be able to make it work for you. You needthe truth in order to deal with things as they are and get predictable results fromthem.The specific application for which you need the truth might be different fromanother persons. You may want to know the truth of a particular mechanical cause-and-effect relationship so you can fix your car. Another person may want thatknowledge in order to build a bomb. And someone else may want it just to maintainhis image as a learned person.The uses may vary, but the principle is always the same: You want the truth soyou can use it to produce a consequence you want.Truth is information that leads to predictable results. So if your understanding ofthe truth works for you, it is true enough  so long as youre2In most cases, I use words as theyre commonly defined; in a few cases, Ive redefinedwords to make them more explicit. Most key words in this book will be defined as theyreintroduced. If youre not sure what I mean by a word, check the Glossary on page290 290.The Identity Traps13prepared for the possibility that the addition of other factors may alter the cause-and-effect relationship.Your ability to get what you want depends upon these considerations: how clearlyyou recognize the identity of each thing and person you deal with, how well youisolate the relevant factors in any cause-and-effect relationship, and how well youallow for the possibility that other factors might alter the relationship.HappinessYou act in ways you believe will produce the consequences you want. But why doyou do that? What is it youre trying to accomplish?You may decide that your goal in life is a good marriage, fame, wealth, or anynumber of other things. But each of these things is only a means to a further end.For example, lets suppose youve decided you want a new car. Why do you want it?It may be that you expect to be free of the mechanical problems that bothered youwith the old car. Or you may expect to receive more respect with a new car. Or youmay expect driving to be more enjoyable.Whatever the reason, its a means to a further end: You believe that getting a new carwill lead to a greater feeling of well-being. You believe youll feel better with the newcar than you would without it.Of the many ways you could spend the money, you believe that getting the carwill produce more mental well-being for you than any other alternative will produce.You will have to forgo some other purchases to do it, but you think that those otherthings wont provide the well-being that a car would.In everything you do, with the knowledge and insight at your disposal, youchoose what you think will give you the most well-being and the least mentaldiscomfort. The objective is what is usually called happiness  the feeling of well-being.Happiness isnt a new car, fame, a good marriage, wealth, or a warm blanket.Those are things. Happiness is what you feel inside of you as a result of the things thathappen to you.Happiness might be produced by a good marriage, fame, a new car, or a warmblanket. For some people, happiness occurs as a result of doing favors for otherpeople; for others, it results from bringing about social reforms; for still others, itcomes from believing theyve outsmarted someone. It might come from a big meal,sexual intercourse, music, art, dancing, singing, working, kissing,14Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldstudying, gardening, resting, etc. These are things that might make an individual feelgood.Its also possible for any of those things to make one feel unhappy  or feel nothingat all.Whether you will be happy, unhappy, or indifferent at any given moment dependsupon who you are and what happens to you. You cant simply decide to be happy andsuddenly feel a gust of mental well-being. If youre not happy at any given time, itsbecause of what is happening to you.Happiness is an emotion  an involuntary reaction to what happens to you. Andunhappiness is an involuntary feeling of discomfort as you react to things that dontsuit your nature.To change your mental state from unhappiness to happiness requires that youchange your circumstances. And this is why you do things  to bring about thecircumstances that will make you happier.Everything you do is motivated by the desire to feel as much happiness aspossible and to eliminate mental discomfort  either in the short term or the longterm.For example, you may work hard at your career for many years because you feelit will all be worth it someday  meaning it will enable you to do the things thatwill make you feel good. Or perhaps the pursuit itself makes you feel better thananything else youve considered.Or you may do certain things because youre afraid that if you dont do them youllfeel bad. You may lend money to your relatives only because youd feel guilty if youdidnt. Or you might go to church each week because youd feel irreverent if youdidnt.A positive decision is one in which you choose among alternatives to maximizeyour happiness. An example would be deciding whether youll be happier going to amovie or a football game.A negative decision is one in which you choose among alternatives to minimizeyour unhappiness. An example would be deciding whether to let your roof leak or todeplete your savings account to get it fixed. Neither choice will increase yourhappiness; youre trying to decide which choice would be the least unpleasant.A free person spends most of his time making positive decisions  choosingamong attractive alternatives.Most people, however, spend most of their time making negative decisions deciding which alternatives would be the least unpleasant, trying to keep things fromgetting worse. As time passes, such a person settles for less and less, believing that itisnt possible to be free and profoundly happy. When you tellThe Identity Traps15him there are ways to break out of the pattern, all he can see is that to do so wouldcause more unpleasantness.There are ways to break out of such patterns, however, and many of those wayswill be suggested as we proceed.Your IdentityWhat makes you happy will depend upon your own personal nature  which isdifferent in many ways from that of any other human being. To try to find happiness bydoing what seems to make others happy is to fall head first into the Identity Trap.Others can suggest what you should do, or what ought to make you happy, butthey will often be wrong. You have to determine for yourself who you are, what makesyou happy, what youre capable of doing, and what you want to do. Be open tosuggestions, but never forfeit the power to make the final decision yourself. Only thencan you act in ways that will bring you happiness.Youre in the Identity Trap when you let others determine whats right or wrongfor you  when you live by unquestioned rules that define how you should act andthink.Youre in the Identity Trap when you try to be interested in something becauseits expected of you, or when you try to do the things that others have said youshould do, or when you try to live up to an image that others say is the only legitimate,valid image youre allowed to have.Youre in the Identity Trap if you allow others to define labels and impose themupon you  such as going to PTA meetings because thats what a good parent issupposed to do, or going to visit your parents every Sunday because a good childwould never do less, or giving up your career because a good wife puts herhusbands career first.Youre in the Identity Trap if you feign an interest in the environment to proveyour civic interest, or give to the poor to prove you arent selfish, or study dullsubjects to appear to be intellectual.Youre in the Identity Trap if you buy a Cadillac to prove youre successful, or asmall foreign car because your friends are anti-Detroit; or if you shave every day to proveyoure respectable, or let your hair grow long to prove you dont conform.In any of these ways, you allow someone else to determine what you should thinkand be. You deny your own self when you suppress desires that arent consideredlegitimate, or when you try to appear to be having fun because everyone else is, orwhen you settle for a certain life because youve been told thats all you shouldexpect in the world.16Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAnd youre in the Identity Trap when you allow others to convince you that youdont even have a right to challenge these things.When you take these various assumptions for granted, youre denying your ownidentity  an identity thats crying out to be expressed in ways that could bring you agreat deal more happiness.No cosmic judge has declared, Thou shalt be a good son, or Thou shalt be asuccessful businessman, or Thou shalt be a good wife and mother. You havechosen, perhaps carelessly, the identities you try to live up to.No one can tell you what identity you should have. But we can discuss someways to look inside yourself to discover the identity thats naturally yours. Only thencan you act consistently, purposefully, and in ways that will bring happiness to you.And every artificial identity that you cast off will bring more freedom to you.Instead of taking for granted assumptions about what you should be, start fromthe inside  from inside of you. Find out who you are  that unique collection offeelings, desires, perceptions, and understanding. Respect what you see in yourself.Then look at the world and decide what you can have that would ignite yournature into real happiness. And then figure out how you can make it happen.Well discuss later some techniques of this self-exploration. If done with energyand honesty, it can be one of the most important, rewarding, and exciting tasks youcan undertake.Let it all come from within you. Dont try to identify with an ideal person, a label,or a code that others think is best for you. They arent you; they cant make yourdecisions for you.The Identities of OthersAt the same time, you can waste precious time when you ignore the individualidentities of other people. They arent you; you cant expect them to be.When you misread someones identity, you expect from him what he cantprovide. You cant make a stone catch fire; neither can you make someone besomething he isnt.Youre in this form of the Identity Trap if you expect your wife to act in certainways because your mother acted that way, or when you assume someone will see thesame logic you see, or if you expect an atheist to accept the principles of Christianity.The Identity Traps17Its so easy to slip into the Identity Trap when dealing with people. You can meetsomeone who has qualities you enjoy, but then find it hard to accept his drawbackswhen they become evident. You wish that somehow the values could stay and thelimitations disappear.And that can tempt you to try to change him, so that hell be everything you want.Unfortunately, however, youll most likely be frustrated in the attempt.This doesnt mean that no one ever changes. People constantly change as theyacquire new knowledge and discover new alternatives. But each person changes inharmony with his own nature, in keeping with his own desires for change and growth,in ways that make sense to him.Recognize each person you deal with as a different, distinct, individual entity, andyou wont have identity problems. Try to avoid labeling individuals and then expectingthem to live up to your labels.You can decide for yourself which of the people you meet have the most to offerto you, and then develop relationships with them  based upon the values that arecompatible between you. The alternative is to throw away your precious life trying tochange others, to make them see what you see, to make them into what you wantthem to be.Each individual seeks happiness for himself in the way that his knowledge andperception indicate to him. He isnt you; dont expect him to be.Avoiding the TrapThere are four basic principles whose recognition can help to avoid the IdentityTrap:1. You are a unique individual  different from all other human beings. No oneelse has the exact same nature that you have; no one else reacts to things in exactlythe way you do. No one else sees the world exactly as you do. No one can dictatewhat your identity should be; you are the best qualified person to discover what it is.2. Each individual is acting from his own knowledge in ways he believes willbring him happiness. He acts to produce the consequences he thinks will make himfeel better.33I could use up pages answering every possible exception to this principle: suicide, masochism,altruism, and so on. In every case, I come to the same conclusion: The individual feels that hisactions will provide more mental well-being or less mental discomfort than anything else hecan think of. To test this conclusion, just ask yourself how the individual would feel if youwere to interfere with his wrist-slashing, getting his daily beating, or doing good works.18Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World3. You have to treat things and people in accordance with their own identities inorder to get what you want from them. You dont expect a stone to be a fish. And itsjust as unrealistic to expect one person to act as someone else does. You dontcontrol the identities of people, but you can control how you deal with them.4. You view the world subjectively  colored by your own experience,interpretation, and limits of perception. It isnt essential that you know the final truthabout everything in the world; and you dont have the resources to discover it.Instead, the test to be applied to any idea is: does it work? Does youridentification of things lead to the consequences you expect? If it does, what youveperceived was true enough for that situation. But recognize the context of the situationand be skeptical when generalizing from that test to draw broader conclusions.These observations can help to keep you out of the Identity Trap. You donthave to try to live a life that isnt yours.What others say you should be is based either upon what they are or uponthe way they feel youd be of more value to them. Neither can be a validbasis for determining how you should live your life. Theyre doing andsaying what makes them happy, and their conclusions are drawn fromtheir own limited, subjective experience.You are what you are. And it will be up to you to discover what that is. Ill helpyou in every way I can in this book, but the decisions will be up to you.The Identity Traps are the belief that you should live in a way determined by othersand the assumption that others will react to things as you would. These two traps arethe most basic of all traps.They might seem terribly obvious to you. If so, good  because the other trapsare much less obvious, and many of them are subtle variations of these two.None of them has to affect your life if you hold to the realization that youre aunique individual, a first in the world, one wholl have to determine for himselfwhat will bring him happiness.If that principle seems far removed from the problem that led you to this book, Ihope to show you shortly that this is the foundation necessary to free yourself of anyrestriction.Until you discover and accept yourself fully, you wont have the conviction orthe courage to be free.The Identity Traps19As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live. Johann Wolfgang von GoetheNature, to be commanded, must be obeyed. Francis Bacon20Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World3The Intellectual and Emotional TrapsTo become free requires a well-conceived plan of action. It cant be achieved byoccasional spur-of-the-moment hunches. To be free, you must know what youre doingand why. Otherwise, slight setbacks can cause you to discard your plans and give up.The two traps covered in this chapter affect the what and why of your actions.When youre in the Emotional Trap, you dont know  in any long-term way what youre doing. And when youre in the Intellectual Trap, the why is lost.The Intellectual TrapThe Intellectual Trap is the belief that your emotions should conform to apreconceived standard.This, of course, is a variation of the Identity Trap, for its an attempt to makeyourself be something you arent.Youre in the Intellectual Trap when you try to deny your bad feelings  such ashate, fear, jealousy, or guilt. Or when you hold back tears because crying isntmanly.Youre in the trap when you try to deny good feelings  such as infatuation forsomeone whos wrong for you, or enjoyment of something thats frowned upon, orwhen you try to make yourself feel good about someone or something that doesntmake you feel good.Youre also in the trap when you believe you should be happy simply becauseyoure doing what youve been told will make you happy.A good example is the businessman who has to keep reminding himself that his$70,000-a-year job and carpeted office are what hes always wanted. Or the womanwho keeps telling herself she must be happy, now that she finally has a husband, fourchildren, and a home in suburbia. Each of them is living a life hes been told should makehim happy; but if it doesnt, he attempts to make his emotions respond.The Intellectual Trap is an attempt to regiment your emotions so that theyll reactaccording to an intellectually determined standard.21An emotion is an involuntary response to something that happens. It isntintentional; you cant command yourself to feel something. But when it happens, yourbody reacts  a warm prickling at the back of your neck, or a twist in your stomach,or a tightening of your chest. And theres usually an urge to express yourselfoutwardly  through laughter, tears, talk, hitting or hugging someone.These are emotions or feelings (Ill use the two words interchangeably) involuntary reactions to something that happens. The two basic emotions arehappiness and unhappiness  the feelings of mental well-being and mentaldiscomfort.Other emotions are variations of those two. Positive emotions include love,affection, self-satisfaction, pride, anticipation of pleasure, any form of the glow we callhappiness. Negative emotions include fear, hate, disappointment, sorrow, jealousy, guilt,any kind of mental discomfort.Happiness is the object of your actions, the consequence you seek when you act.But its important to remember that happiness is an emotion. You cant turn it on atwill. You feel it as an involuntary response to the conditions in your life at a givenmoment.Your emotional nature (like almost everything about you) is unique. What makessomeone else happy might be interesting, curious, even fascinating to know; but itdoesnt tell you what would make you happy.You cant find happiness by telling yourself to be happy. Nor can you find it bydoing the things that others have said make them happy. Nor can you find it by tellingyourself that a good man or a moral woman or a rational person would behappy doing a certain list of things.To find happiness, you must know how your unique emotional nature respondsto things. You must observe and take seriously your own emotional reactions. For ifyou attempt to fit your emotions to a preconceived standard, you lose touch with yourselfand blind yourself to the most important part of yourself  to what would make youhappy.If you do that, theres no reason to be surprised if doing the good thingsdoesnt produce great joy for you. Life will be relatively tasteless, gray, and boring ifyou deny the very emotions that could tell you what makes life joyous and exciting.That doesnt mean you have to be a slave to your emotions. You can getinto trouble by responding rashly to your feelings. The recognition of afeeling isnt a command to act in a given way. There are alternatives ways of satisfying an emotion without getting into trouble. But if yourefuse to recognize emotions, youre acting at cross-purposes withyourself. Youre denying you.22Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldNegative EmotionsNegative emotions can act as signals to you, letting you know theres anuncomfortable part of your life that needs attention.For example, if you feel jealous about someone, it may mean youre not sure therelationship you have is really right for you, and youre afraid it can be taken fromyou easily. If you hate, it might mean youve made yourself vulnerable to someonewhose desires are in conflict with yours, and hes using that power in ways that hurtyou. And if youre afraid, you may have put yourself in a dangerous position youre notequipped to handle.To deny those emotions will leave the problem unsolved and make them morelikely to recur in the future. You cant wish away negative emotions; but if yourecognize them, you can take steps to eliminate them.To acknowledge your discomfort doesnt obligate you to act on the urge thataccompanies it. What you do about the situation is a separate matter; there are usuallyseveral alternatives.To be jealous doesnt mean you must restrict your lovers activities. To hatedoesnt mean you have to attack. To be afraid doesnt mean you have to run(although that may sometimes be the best course of action).Another way of denying your emotions is to convince yourself you wont beafraid in a given situation. You dive into it, knowing you should be able to handleit, and create more problems for yourself. Your mind is clouded by the fear you weredetermined not to feel, and you cant handle the situation effectively.You cant be something you arent. Dont tell yourself you can do things if yourexperience tells you that you cant. First, youll have to increase your ability to deal withsuch situations; and that takes more than false confidence.Dont try to deal coolly with an individual whose presence always infuriates you.Recognize your reaction and find a way to deal with him that doesnt require aconfrontation. Or better yet, arrange things so you dont have to deal with him at all.This applies especially to critical matters  cases where you have a great deal tolose by getting into something you cant handle. Dont try to stand up to youremployer if you always go to pieces when you walk into his office.In smaller matters, you can afford to be more adventurous. You can use easiersituations to test and enlarge your capabilities, so long as you recognize and acceptthe risks involved.The Intellectual & Emotional Traps23Positive EmotionsIts just as damaging to deny your positive emotions. Certain things that pleaseyou may be frowned upon by your friends or associates. But so what? Your happinessis the object of your actions; what difference does it make that others happen to havesome ideas of what is correct?If you like country music more than symphonies, why deny it or feel selfconsciousabout it? If you prefer watching TV to reading Shakespeare, so what? Dont beintimidated by common intellectual standards; theyre of no importance compared toyour own reactions.I know it can be easy to be frightened by an emotion if it seems to threaten yourpresent way of life. You can even have an emotional reaction to an emotionalreaction.For example, it may bother you if youre attracted to a woman other than yourwife. You may feel that since youre married, youre going to stay married, and thatyou dont want anything to interfere with that. But the recognition that you feelsomething for another woman isnt a command that you get a divorce or commitadultery. It can be a signal to alert you to deficiencies in your marriage  thingsyoure missing. Make use of the signal; look for ways to fill in whats missing withinthe context of your marriage.That a married person must be monogamous in mind as well as in action is simplyone more example of an intellectually determined standard. If your best friend says henever even notices anyone other than his spouse, thats not an indication of what youshould expect of yourself.Your emotions can also be signals that its time to re-examine your existingvalues. Perhaps theyre alerting you that youve inadvertently moved away from yourown best interests.Your positive emotions are the seeds of a tastier life. Theyre trying to tell youhow you can be happy. If you ignore them, suppress them, or deny them, you lose thevital guideposts that could lead you toward happiness.Most people are capable of profound, rich emotions; they have the potential fordeep and lasting happiness. But theyve tuned themselves out in an attempt to be whattheyve been told they should be. Its not surprising that they cant really imagine lastinghappiness.In the TrapYoure in the Intellectual Trap any time you try to censor your emotions sotheyll conform to an intellectually determined standard, no matter how plausible thestandard.24Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldYoure in the trap when you believe you shouldnt feel warmly toward someoneyouve been told to dislike. Or when you decide you should admire someone whomeveryone knows is a great person. Or when you believe you should love yourmother  even if theres nothing lovable about her.Youre in the trap when you continue to do something long after youve stoppedenjoying it, or if its something you never enjoyed much to begin with, or if yourebored by most everything you do.If you find that you dont feel enthusiastic about anything, it may be because youvelost touch with your emotions  the source that can tell you what would bringexcitement to your life. Thats where you must look for the answer.If you deny your feelings, all the intelligent thinking and planning in the worldwont lead to happiness.The Emotional TrapThe Emotional Trap is the belief that you can make important decisions at a timewhen youre feeling strong emotions. Its the reverse side of the Intellectual Trap.Not only do you feel; you think. Thinking is the conscious, deliberate, volitionalattempt to perceive identities and utilize them. You can think to observe, to identify,to create, and to establish the conditions necessary for your happiness. Your thinkingand action create conditions to which you respond emotionally.You think in order to be able to feel happiness.Thinking is the means; feeling is the end.Your emotional responses tell you what things make you happy and unhappy.But at the moments when you feel strong emotions such as hate, infatuation, anger,or excitement, your thinking is usually clouded. The Emotional Trap is the belief thatyou can make important decisions at such a time. Thats the time when youre leastlikely to recognize all the alternatives and consequences.For example, youre in the Emotional Trap if you decide to propose marriagebecause of a sudden infatuation. Or if you decide to quit your job while engulfed by angerat your boss or associates. Or if you decide to respond to sexual arousal in waysyouve already realized could cause trouble for you.These emotions are very real and must be recognized. But you cant make thebest decision at the moment youre engulfed by them. Youre bound to overlookmany important considerations.If youre infatuated with someone, enjoy it; revel in the glow for all its worth.But dont try to make important long-term decisions at such a time. CanThe Intellectual & Emotional Traps25you imagine how many disastrous marriages are the result of such passing glows?If youre enraged about your job, go off by yourself, relax, and wait until yourmind clears. Then consider all the ramifications. You might still decide to resign ifyou believe such moments of anger are too high a price to pay for your income. But ifso, youll have decided at a time when youre equipped to do so  and youll be betterable to stick by your decision.If youve decided that certain types of sexual encounters could cause trouble for you,respect that decision. You cant reopen the case intelligently when youre breathlesswith excitement and the bosss wife is about to change into something morecomfortable. Tomorrow morning you can re-examine the rules and the possibleconsequences involved. You might decide then to change your values, but you mayalso remember a number of good reasons for making your original decision.Ive found that its a good rule to never make an important decision when youremotions are in control. I try to program myself in advance to remember this rulewhen I need it. When Im in an emotional state (either positive or negative), I try tokeep just enough intellect working to tell me one thing: dont decide now. I wait untilIve relaxed and can think more clearly.4The Expanding CycleUnfortunately, many people act upon their emotions the moment they occur.Such a person doesnt want to take the time to recognize all the considerationsinvolved. Afterward, he may have to pay an extremely high price for a brief episode ofhappiness.I once knew a woman who was basically quite intelligent, but her blind spotseemed to be this urge to act before recognizing the consequences. She hastilymarried a man who was exciting but not compatible with her. When things wentpoorly in the marriage, she suddenly knew that a baby would bring them closertogether.She stayed in that mood long enough to get pregnant. Needless to say, the babyonly complicated matters  creating financial crises to go with their other problems.Ill skip over a few of the other crises and hasty decisions until we get to the thirdbaby.By that time, she knew for sure that she was in the wrong place. When she finallygot out of the marriage, she had three children, no income-producing skills, and wasdependent for child support on an unreliable man.26Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World4The word intellect will be used interchangeably withthinking, in the same way thatemotion and feeling are being used synonymously.That led to another loveless marriage as a final solution to her financialproblems. That didnt work either, of course, but it was even harder to get out of.As I said, she was basically intelligent. But she was unable to program herself toavoid important decisions when her emotions were dominant. There were alwaysother alternatives to her actions, but she could never see them at the time of decision.Eventually she came to feel that life itself was cruel, that other people were causingher problems, and that it was unfair to demand a high price of her when she was theone who was being mistreated. To her, freedom was a joke.She reached the point where there was no way she could support herself and thechildren, so she finally let her first husband have custody of them. Because she lovedthem, she paid a terrible price for the rash decisions shed made in the past. Each timeshed made one of those decisions, she was sure she was escaping a difficult price,while in reality she was only adding to the price shed have to pay someday.In the TrapThe Emotional Trap is typified by the assumption that ones feelings of themoment will be permanent. This inspires actions that produce consequences that stillhave to be dealt with after the feelings have passed.Youre in the Emotional Trap whenever you promise favors to friends or familyin a glow of affection but regret your promises later. Or when you lose more moneythan you can afford in the stock market because its fun to act on hunches. Or whenyou buy an $8,000 piano you dont know how to play because the idea suddenlyexcites you.Immediate pleasures can turn into permanent pains when you act as if theemotions of the moment are all the information you need to consider. Youre ignoringconsequences  including the possibility that what you feel now may change.Youre not likely to get entangled in the Emotional Trap if you recognize youremotions, respect them, create plans to satisfy them, and carry out those plans always allowing for changes in you, as well as in the world.Intellect and EmotionsYour intellect and your emotions are both essential, real parts of you. Each has afunction; neither can be disregarded if youre to get what you want in life. To denyeither of them is to fall into one of the traps.Youre in the Intellectual Trap if you let your intellect tell you what you shouldfeel.The Intellectual & Emotional Traps27Youre in the Emotional Trap if you let your emotions make important decisionsfor you.Both traps lead to trouble.You have to know what youre doing and why. The Emotional Trap blinds you towhat youre doing because you cant see the consequences clearly. And theIntellectual Trap cuts you off from the only important why connected with youractions  knowing that what youre doing will lead to what you know will createhappiness.To achieve genuine, durable happiness, you have to recognize your emotionalnature and intelligently think ahead to create situations that will trigger happy emotionsfrom your unique nature.Then, when your plans have produced what you wanted, you can disregard yourintellect, relax, and just feel. Youll be able to act spontaneously within that contextbecause youve eliminated any possibility of bad consequences.Then you can allow yourself to be engulfed in a flow of genuine positiveemotions.And thats what life is all about.No one has ever talked himself (or anyone else) out of an undesiredemotion by hurling insults or by delivering a morallecture. Nathaniel Branden28Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World4The Morality TrapThe Morality Trap is the belief that you must obey a moral code created bysomeone else.This trap is a variation of the Identity Trap in that it leads you to try to besomething other than yourself. Its an easy trap to get caught in and an easy way tolose your freedom.Morality is a powerful word. Perhaps even more powerful is the word immoral.In an attempt to avoid being labeled immoral, many people allow themselves to bemanipulated by others.What Is Morality?At the same time, the concept of morality is very vague. What is it? Where does itcome from? What purpose does it serve? How is it determined?My dictionary defines morality as Moral quality or character; rightness orwrongness, as of an action. Well then, lets refer to the definition of moral, which is:Related to, serving to teach, or in accordance with, the principles of right andwrong.Now were getting somewhere; all we need is a definition of right. And I supposeyou can guess what that is: In accordance with justice, law, morality,Unfortunately, this definitional merry-go-round is typical of the commonunderstanding of morality. You should do something because its right  but bywhat standard?It seems to me that there are three different kinds of morality. I call thempersonal, universal, and absolute. By looking at each of them, I think we can get aclearer idea of what morality is and how it can be useful in helping you to achieveyour freedom.5Websters New World Dictionary of the American Language, 1966 edition; WorldPublishing Company, New York.etc.529Personal MoralityWeve seen that you act in ways you hope will bring the best consequences toyou. And the best consequences are those that bring you happiness.You always have to consider the consequences of your actions; theyre the pointof anything you do. However, any given act will undoubtedly cause manyconsequences. You may see that a particular action will produce a consequence youwant, but you might also be aware that it could produce other consequences youdont want.For example, suppose you say, All I want is a million dollars. Probably the quickestway of getting it would be to buy a gun and rob the largest bank in town. If getting amillion dollars were all that mattered to you, that would be an obvious choice.But the million dollars isnt all you want. There are other considerations, such as:You want to keep the money (longer than just until youre arrested); you want to spendthe money on things you like (not on hiding from the FBI); you want to enjoy thethings the money can buy (none of which is possible in jail).Its unrealistic, then, to say, All I want is a million dollars. The money is a means toother ends, and it has to be obtained in a way that wont interfere with those ends.Otherwise, you might do something (such as robbing a bank) that would make itimpossible to achieve what you really want.The original statement would be closer to the truth if it were phrased, What I wantis enough money to buy the things I want and to be free to enjoy those things and tohave the respect of people I like and without obtaining the money in a way that willinterfere with other values that are more important to me.Since youre always seeking numerous different goals, you try to foresee theways in which something immediately desirable might get in the way of other thingsthat are more desirable in the long run. You try to consider more than just whatsimmediately in front of you. Youre placing things in a broader context.Obviously, you cant expect to foresee all the consequences of a given act, butyou can try to see all the significant ones. In some cases, such as the bank-robbingexample, there are obvious consequences that immediately rule out a proposed courseof action.In other cases, more subtle possibilities will be recognized after a few minutesthought. But there will also be cases in which you wont be aware of the specificconsequences until after youve acted and begun to experience them.Code of ConductBecause you cant foresee all the specific consequences of what you do, theres aneed to have some generalized rules available that can help keep you30Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldout of situations that could be troublesome. Those rules can be valuable if they do twothings: (1) steer you away from potential disasters; and (2) remind you of the thingsyou must do to satisfy your most important long-term desires.The basic question is: How can I get something I want without hurting mychances for other things that are more important to me?It is this generalized, long-term attitude that underlies an individuals basic codeof conduct. And when we speak of morality, I cant think of any other sensible reasonto be concerned about the subject. Its purpose is to keep you aimed in the directionyou most want to go.Personal morality is an attempt to consider all the relevant consequences of youractions.Relevant means those consequences that will affect you. How your actions affectothers is only important insofar as that, in turn, affects you.A personal morality is basic to your overall view of how youll find happiness.Its so important that a later chapter will be devoted entirely to questions that can helpyou form such a morality for yourself.And its important that you form it yourself. No one else (including me) isqualified to tell you how to live. A realistic morality has to consider many personalfactors: your emotional nature, abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and, most important,your goals.Your code of conduct has to be consistent with your goals so that you dont doanything that would make those goals unattainable. A code devised by someone elsewill necessarily be based upon the goals he believes possible and desirable.To be useful, a morality shouldnt include rules for every possible situation. Itshouldnt be concerned with minor questions involving only immediate consequences.Its devised to prevent big problems for you and to keep you aimed toward the goalsthat mean the most to you. Moral questions are concerned only with matters thatinvolve large consequences.Theres a difference, for instance, between investing three dollars in a movie thatmight prove to be a dud and investing your life savings in a risky business venture.Theres also a difference between tasting a different food thats commonly eaten (suchas snails) and sampling toadstools in the forest. The first might cause a stomachache;the second could poison you.A useful morality will prevent you from doing things that might take years to correct,while keeping you aimed in the direction of the things that are most important to you.And since such matters are an outgrowth of your own personal values, itsobvious that no one else can create your morality for you.The Morality Trap31A personal morality is the attempt to consider all the relevant consequences ofyour actions. This is only one of three common types of moralities, however.Universal MoralityThe second type is a morality that is meant to apply to everyone in the world. Auniversal morality is one thats supposed to bring happiness to anyone who uses it.When youre exposed to the ideas of someone who has apparently done well withhis own life, its easy to conclude that he has all the final answers. His reasoningmakes sense to you; he has results to show for his ideas. What further proof could youneed to demonstrate that he knows how to live?He probably does know how to live  his life. It would be foolish not toconsider the ideas such a person offers. But it would also be foolish to expect that, asintelligent as he may be, he could have answers that apply to every life in the world.His ideas have worked for him because hes been wise enough to develop ideasthat are consistent with his own nature. He hasnt tried to live by the standards createdby others; hes found his own. And thats vitally important.You must do the same thing  if you want your code of conduct to work thatwell for you. Your rules have to consider everything thats unique about you  youremotions, your aptitudes, your weak points, your hopes and fears.When you try to live by someone elses rules, you can get yourself into lots andlots of trouble. For example, you can be told that a certain type of action will lead to acertain emotion; and you can suffer a lot of guilt and frustration trying to make youremotions conform to your expectations.Or you can spend your life living in a way that doesnt evoke happiness from yourunique nature. And along the way, you might be encouraged to discard the very thingsthat could have led to genuine happiness for you.Or you can create problems with others by being sure that they, too, should actby the same code.Ive met dozens of people who knew they were right about what they were doingand could cite the authority who told them so. But not one of them seemed to begenuinely comfortable in the life style he had assumed.The easiest time to fall into the trap is when youre exposed to someone whoseideas do make a lot of sense. If what he says is logical to you  more logical thanwhat youve heard before  the temptation can be very great to adopt all his ways.Someone like that should be considered very seriously but not accepted in toto.32Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldA universal morality is a code of conduct that is presumed to bring happiness toanyone who uses it. I dont believe there can be such a thing. The differences betweenindividuals are far too great to allow for anything but the most general kinds of rules.Absolute MoralityTheres a third kind of morality. The first two are attempts to help you achievehappiness  one self-directed and the other coming from someone else. The thirdtype is the opposite of this. An absolute morality is a set of rules to which anindividual is expected to surrender his own happiness.There are two main characteristics of an absolute morality:1. It presumably comes from an authority outside the individual. Itcomes from someone or somewhere more important than theindividual himself.2. It proposes that the individual should be moral regardless of theconsequences to himself. In other words, doing what is right ismore important than ones own happiness.These two characteristics intertwine, so well consider them together.Absolute morality is the most common type of morality, and it can be prettyintimidating. You can be made to appear selfish, whim-worshipping, egotistic,hedonistic, or ruthless, if you merely assert that your own happiness is the mostimportant thing in your life.But what could be more important than your happiness? Its said that anauthoritarian moral code is necessary to protect society. But who is society? Isnt it just alarge group of people, all of whom have differing ideas concerning how one shouldlive?And if an individual is required to give up his own happiness for society, of whatvalue is society to him?Its also suggested that God commanded that we live by certain rules. But whocan be sure he knows exactly when and how and what God said and what he meant?And even if that could be established once and for all, what would be theconsequences to the individual if he acted otherwise? How do we know?And if the code did come from God, it still had to be handled by human beings onits way to you. Whatever the absolute morality may be, youre relying upon someoneelse to vouch for its authority.Suppose you use a holy book as your guide. I havent yet seen one that doesnthave some apparent contradictions regarding conduct in it. Those contradictions maydisappear with the proper interpretation; but who providesThe Morality Trap33the interpretation? Youll do it yourself or youll select someone to provide it for you.In either case, you have become the authority by making the choice.Theres no way someone else can become your authority; the decision will beyours in choosing the morality youll live by  even if you choose to cite someoneelse (youve chosen) as the authority for your acts.And theres no way you can ignore the consequences to yourself; a human beingnaturally acts in terms of consequences.What happens, however, is that other people introduce consequences that they hopewill influence you. They say that your immoral acts will: prevent you from going toheaven  or cause other people to disapprove of you  or destroy society and causechaos, and it will all be your fault.Once again, however, it will be you deciding for yourself whether any of theseconsequences will result and whether any of them are important to you.The absolute morality fails on its two important characteristics. Even if youchoose to believe theres a higher authority, you are the authority who chooses what itis and what it is telling you to do. And since youll always be considering consequences, evenif you try to fix it so that you arent, its important to deliberately recognize theconsequences and decide which ones are important to you.MoralityNo matter how we approach the subject, we always wind up at the same place:No one can decide for you what is moral. So no matter what it may be, you are livingby a personal morality. The question is whether or not youre acting deliberately tomake it the morality that will bring you the kind of life you want for yourself.Im not suggesting that there is no right and wrong. There most assuredly is.Right is what will bring you happiness. And wrong is what will cause youunhappiness. The same definitions apply to the words good and bad.And since there are no simple answers that can tell you what will bring you long-term happiness, what is right isnt necessarily the temptation in front of you at a givenmoment. A personal morality is vital because it can keep you aimed in the directionmost important to you in the long-term.You cant successfully devise such a morality until you know who you are andwhat you want. And since no one else can answer those questions, no one else isqualified to tell you how to get what you want.34Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThe TrapI realize that, to some people, the concept of a personal, self-determined moralityis revolutionary  possibly even appalling. It is contrary to the absolute moralities mostpeople grew up with. And in addition to other decisions, youll have to decide if whatIve said has made sense to you. Whether or not you agree with me isnt as important toyou as knowing why you believe as you do  and knowing what consequences yourbeliefs will produce.The Morality Trap is the belief that you must obey a moral code created bysomeone else. If youre acting in ways you hope will satisfy someone elses conceptof what is moral, chances are youre using an ill-suited code of conduct  one thatwont lead you to what you want and that may trap you in commitments andcomplications that can only cause you unhappiness. So in terms of the trap, what youdo isnt as significant as why you do it.Youre in the trap if you hand a very important dollar to a beggar because itswrong to be selfish. Or if you continue to deal respectfully with someone whosmade trouble for you because to forgive is divine.Youre in the trap if you allow yourself to be drafted because you have a duty toyour country. Or if you prohibit drinking in your home because it would weakenthe moral fiber of society. Or if you send your children to Sunday school eventhough you arent religious, because you should give them a moral upbringing.You might have very good reasons for any of these actions. But if you do themonly in obedience to moral clichs, youre in the Morality Trap.Pressure from OthersThere are plenty of people who will be delighted to tell you how to live. Youllhear the words moral and immoral often enough.A person who tells you to act morally might have any one of a number ofreasons. He may really believe that your moral conduct is essential to the future of theworld. Or he may believe that hes Gods appointed policeman. Or he may be usingmorality as a weapon to pressure you to do whats best for him. Or he may just havenothing better to do with his time.Whatever his reason, remember that its his reason. Too often, morality is usedmerely as a tool by which one person hopes to manipulate another.Your reasons for how you live will necessarily be your own. No one knows youas you can know yourself. And only from that self-understanding can you hope tocreate a code of conduct that will bring you the freedom and happiness you crave.The Morality Trap35A useful morality should recognize that other people think differently from theway you do. And it should provide ways of handling those differences withoutbowing to the dictates of others. There are ways of eliminating the pressure withoutgiving in  as Ill suggest in Chapter 17.Your MoralityYou are responsible for what happens to you (even if someone else offers toaccept that responsibility), because youre the one wholl experience theconsequences of your acts.You are the one who decides what is right and what is wrong  no matter whatmeaning others may attach to those words. You dont have to obey blindly thedictates that you grew up with or that you hear around you now. Everything can bechallenged, should be challenged, examined to determine its relevance to you andwhat you want.As you examine the teachings of others, you may find that some of it is veryappropriate to you, but much of it may be meaningless or even harmful. Theimportant thing is to carefully reappraise any moral precept that has been guiding youractions.As you examine each of the rules youve been living by, ask yourself: Is this rule something that others have devised on behalf ofsociety to restrain individuals? Or have I devised it in order to make mylife better for myself? Am I acting by an old, just-happens-to-be-there morality? Or is itsomething Ive personally determined from the knowledge of who I amand what I want? Are the rewards and punishments attached to the rules vague andintangible? Or do the rules point to specific happiness I can achieve orunhappiness I can avoid? Is it a morality Ive accepted because someone undoubtedlyknows the reason for it? Or is it one Ive created because I know thereason for it? Is it a morality thats currently in style and accepted by allthose around me? Or is it a morality specifically tailored to my style? Is it a morality thats aimed at me and against my self-interest?Or is it a morality thats for me and comes from me?All the answers must come from you  not from a book or a lecture or a sermon.To assume that someone once wrote down the final answers for your36Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldmorality is to assume that the writer stopped growing the day he wrote the code.Dont treat him unfairly by thinking that he couldnt have discovered more andincreased his own understanding after hed written the code. And dont forget thatwhat he wrote was based upon what he saw and what he wanted from life.No matter how you approach the matter, you are the sovereign authority whomakes the final decisions. The more you realize that, the more your decisions will fitrealistically with your own life.Personal morality is an attempt to consider all the relevant consequences of youracts. If you think out your morality for yourself, it should open up a better life that willbe free from the bad consequences that complicate matters.And it should lead you more directly to those things that bring you happiness.Along the way, you should be able to act more freely; for once youve looked ahead torecognize potentially troublesome situations, youre free to act more impulsively inpleasant circumstances  knowing theres no danger that bad problems will ensue.When you decide to take matters into your own hands, someone may askyou, Who do you think you are? Who are you to decide for yourself inthe face of society and centuries of moral teachings?The answer is simple: You are you, the person who will live with theconsequences of what you do. No one else can be responsible, becauseno one else will experience the consequences of your actions as you will.The Morality Trap37If youre wrong, you will suffer for it. If youre right, you will findhappiness. You have to be the one to decide.Who are you to know? Its your future at stake. You have to know.Freedom comes only from seeing the ignorance of your critics anddiscovering the emptiness of their virtue.David SeaburyVolumes might be written upon the impiety of the pious. Herbert Spencer38Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World5The Unselfishness TrapThe Unselfishness Trap is the belief that you must put the happiness of othersahead of your own.Unselfishness is a very popular ideal, one thats been honored throughoutrecorded history. Wherever you turn, you find encouragement to put the happiness ofothers ahead of your own  to do whats best for the world, not for yourself.If the ideal is sound, there must be something unworthy in seeking to live your lifeas you want to live it.So perhaps we should look more closely at the subject  to see if the ideal issound. For if you attempt to be free, we can assume that someones going to considerthat to be selfish.We saw in Chapter 2 that each person always acts in ways he believes will makehim feel good or will remove discomfort from his life. Because everyone is different fromeveryone else, each individual goes about it in his own way.One person devotes his life to helping the poor. Another one lies and steals. Stillanother person tries to create better products and services for which he hopes to bepaid handsomely. One woman devotes herself to her husband and children. Anotherseeks a career as a singer.In every case, the basic motivation has been the same. Each person is doing whathe believes will bring him happiness. What varies between them is the means each haschosen to gain his happiness.We could divide them into two groups labeled selfish and unselfish, but I dontthink that would prove anything. For the thief and the humanitarian each have thesame motive  to do what he believes will make him feel good.In fact, we cant avoid a very significant conclusion: Everyone is selfish.Selfishness isnt really an issue, because everyone selfishly seeks his own happiness.What we need to examine, however, are the means various people choose to achievetheir happiness. Unfortunately, some people oversimplify the matter by assuming thatthere are only two basic means: sacrifice yourself for others or make them sacrificefor you. Happily, theres a third way that can produce better consequences than eitherof those two.39A Better World?Lets look first at the ideal of living for the benefit of others. Its often said that itwould be a better world if everyone were unselfish. But would it be?If it were somehow possible for everyone to give up his own happiness, whatwould be the result? Lets carry it to its logical conclusion and see what we find. Tovisualize it, lets imagine that happiness is symbolized by a big red rubber ball. I havethe ball in my hands  meaning that I hold the ability to be happy. But since Im notgoing to be selfish, I quickly pass the ball to you. Ive given up my happiness for you.What will you do? Since youre not selfish either, you wont keep the ball; youllquickly pass it on to your next-door neighbor. But he doesnt want to be selfish either,so he passes it to his wife, who likewise gives it to her children.The children have been taught the virtue of unselfishness, so they pass it toplaymates, who pass it to parents, who pass it to neighbors, and on and on and on.I think we can stop the analogy at this point and ask whats been accomplished byall this effort. Whos better off for these demonstrations of pure unselfishness?How would it be a better world if everyone acted that way? Whom would we beunselfish for? There would have to be a selfish person who would receive, accept,and enjoy the benefits of our unselfishness for there to be any point to it. But thatselfish person (the object of our generosity) would be living by lower standards thanwe do.For a more practical example, what is achieved by the parent who sacrificeshimself for his children, who in turn are expected to sacrifice themselves for theirchildren, etc.? The unselfishness concept is a merry-go-round that has no purpose.No ones self-interest is enhanced by the continual relaying of gifts from one person toanother to another.Perhaps most people have never carried the concept of unselfishness to thislogical conclusion. If they did, they might reconsider their pleas for an unselfishworld.Negative ChoicesBut, unfortunately, the pleas continue, and theyre a very real part of your life. Inseeking your own freedom and happiness, you have to deal with those who tell youthat you shouldnt put yourself first. That creates a situation in which yourepressured to act negatively  to put aside your plans and desires in order to avoidthe condemnation of others.40Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAs Ive said before, one of the characteristics of a free person is that hes usuallychoosing positively  deciding which of several alternatives would make him thehappiest  while the average person, most of the time, is choosing which of two orthree alternatives will cause him the least discomfort.When the reason for your actions is to avoid being called selfish youre makinga negative decision and thereby restricting the possibilities for your own happiness.Youre in the Unselfishness Trap if you regretfully pay for your aunts surgerywith the money youd saved for a new car, or if you sadly give up the vacation youdlooked forward to in order to help a sick neighbor.Youre in the trap if you feel youre required to give part of your income to thepoor, or if you think that your country, community, or family has first claim on yourtime, energy, or money.Youre in the Unselfishness Trap any time you make negative choices that aredesigned to avoid being called selfish.It isnt that no one else is important. You might have a self-interest in someoneswell-being, and giving a gift can be a gratifying expression of the affection you feel forhim. But youre in the trap if you do such things in order to appear unselfish.Helping OthersThere is an understandable urge to give to those who are important and close to you.However, that leads many people to think that indiscriminate giving is the key to onesown happiness. They say that the way to be happy is to make others happy; get yourglow by basking in the glow youve created for someone else.Its important to identify that as a personal opinion. If someone says that giving isthe key to happiness, isnt he saying thats the key to his happiness? To assume that hisopinions are binding upon you is a common form of the Identity Trap.I think we can carry the question further, however, and determine how efficientsuch a policy might be. The suggestion to be a giver presupposes that youre able tojudge what will make someone else happy. And experience has taught me to be a bithumble about assuming what makes others happy.My landlady once brought me a piece of her freshly baked cake because shewanted to do me a favor. Unfortunately, it happened to be a kind of cake that wasdistasteful to me. I wont try to describe the various ways I tried to get the cake plateback to her without being confronted with a request for my judgment of her cake. Itssufficient to say that her well-intentioned favor interfered with my own plans.The Unselfishness Trap41And now, whenever Im sure I know what someone else needs, I remember thatincident and back off a little. Theres no way that one person can read the mind ofanother to know all his plans, goals, and tastes.You may know a great deal about the desires of your intimate friends. Butindiscriminate gift-giving and favor-doing is usually a waste of resources  or, worse, itcan upset the well-laid plans of the receiver.When you give to someone else, you might provide something he values  butprobably not the thing he considers most important. If you expend those resources foryourself, you automatically devote them to what you consider to be most important.The time or money youve spent will most likely create more happiness that way.If your purpose is to make someone happy, youre more apt to succeed if youmake yourself the object. Youll never know another person more than a fraction aswell as you can know yourself.Do you want to make someone happy? Go to it  use your talents and yourinsight and benevolence to bestow riches of happiness upon the one person youunderstand well enough to do it efficiently  yourself. I guarantee that youll getmore genuine appreciation from yourself than from anyone else.Give to you.Support your local self.AlternativesAs I indicated earlier in this chapter, its too often assumed that there are onlytwo alternatives: (1) sacrifice your interests for the benefit of others; or (2) makeothers sacrifice their interests for you. If nothing else were possible, it would indeedbe a grim world.Fortunately, theres more to the world than that. Because desires vary fromperson to person, its possible to create exchanges between individuals in which bothparties benefit.For example, if you buy a house, you do so because youd rather have the housethan the money involved. But the sellers desire is different  hed rather have themoney than the house. When the sale is completed, each of you has receivedsomething of greater value than what you gave up  otherwise you wouldnt haveentered the exchange. Who, then, has had to sacrifice for the other?In the same way, your daily life is made up of dozens of such exchanges  smalland large transactions in which each party gets something he values more than what hegives up. The exchange doesnt have to involve money; you may be spending time,attention, or effort in exchange for something you value.42Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldMutually beneficial relationships are possible when desires are compatible.Sometimes the desires are the same  like going to a movie together. Sometimes thedesires are different  like trading your money for someones house. In either case,its the compatibility of the desires that makes the exchange possible.No sacrifice is necessary when desires are compatible. So it makes sense to seekout people with whom you can have mutually beneficial relationships.Often the unselfishness issue arises only because two people with nothing incommon are trying to get along together  such as a man who likes bowling andhates opera married to a woman whose tastes are the opposite. If theyre to do thingstogether, one must sacrifice his pleasure for the other. So each might try to encouragethe other to be unselfish.If they were compatible, the issue wouldnt arise because each would be pleasingthe other by doing what was in his own self-interest.An efficiently selfish person is sensitive to the needs and desires of others. But hedoesnt consider those desires to be demands upon him. Rather, he sees them asopportunities  potential exchanges that might be beneficial to him. He identifies desiresin others so that he can decide if exchanges with them will help him get what he wants.He doesnt sacrifice himself for others, nor does he expect others to be sacrificedfor him. He takes the third alternative  he finds relationships that are mutuallybeneficial so that no sacrifice is required.Please YourselfEveryone is selfish; everyone is doing what be believes will make himself happier.The recognition of that can take most of the sting out of accusations that youre beingselfish. Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when thats whateveryone else is doing, too?The demand that you be unselfish can be motivated by any number of reasons:that you should help create a better world, that you have a moral obligation to beunselfish, that you give up your happiness to the selfishness of someone else, or thatthe person demanding it has just never thought it out.Whatever the reason, youre not likely to convince such a person to stop hisdemands. But it will create much less pressure on you if you realize that its his selfishreason. And you can eliminate the problem entirely by looking for more compatiblecompanions.To find constant, profound happiness requires that you be free to seek thegratification of your own desires. It means making positive choices.The Unselfishness Trap43If you slip into the Unselfishness Trap, youll spend a good part of your time makingnegative choices  trying to avoid the censure of those who tell you not to think ofyourself. You wont have time to be free.If someone finds happiness by doing good works for others, let him. Thatdoesnt mean thats the best way for you to find happiness.And when someone accuses you of being selfish, just remember that hes upsetonly because you arent doing what he selfishly wants you to do.Poke any saint deeply enough, and you touch self-interest. Irving Wallace44Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World6The Group TrapThe Group Trap is the belief that you can accomplish more by sharingresponsibilities, efforts, and rewards with others than you can by acting on your own.Its an easy trap to fall into. Its a common expression that in union there isstrength. Just the opposite is true, however. You achieve more for yourself whenyour rewards are dependent upon your own efforts rather than upon the efforts ofother people.When you join a group effort to achieve freedom, you usually waste preciousresources on an endeavor that has very little chance of success. In the same way, groupefforts are common in businesses, marriages, and even friendships, and there too theGroup Trap can cause subtle problems.Groups are not living entities. They dont think or act; only individuals do. Andyet, any group effort is based upon the assumption of a group purpose that overridesthe individual differences of its members. Its expected that the group will act as asingle unit with a unified purpose.Only individuals think  and each one thinks in his own way. Interests anddesires may overlap, but each person will continue to define his own objectives andhave his own opinion concerning the best way to achieve those objectives.Perhaps each person entering a group unconsciously assumes that it will act inunison for his objectives and by his methods. But every other participant probably hasa similar assumption regarding his ideas.What they get instead will inevitably be a compromise. The individuals goals andhis concept of the best methods will be automatically compromised before anythinghappens to further his objectives.It also means that a certain amount of time and effort will have to be expended toarrange the compromise  again, before anything concrete is done to further theobjectives.On the other hand, the individual who acts alone doesnt have to alter hisobjectives. He can employ the means he considers best suited to the objective, and hedoesnt have to waste time and effort trying to arrange a compromise with partners.45IncentiveAnother problem is encountered in group endeavors. When the efforts andrewards are shared, it becomes apparent that the individuals own efforts will have aless significant effect upon his eventual reward than if he were acting alone.Suppose that the group consists of two people  a business partnership, forinstance. If the two partners have agreed to work equally hard and share the rewards50-50, the significance of each persons efforts has been cut by 50%. Whatever valuethe individual provides to the group, hell receive only half of its reward.Of course, he expects to get half the value added by the other person, too; but hedoesnt control the other persons effort. He controls only his own effort. So what hecontrols will produce only a half reward.The situation is worse if the group is larger. If one hundred people are engaged ina crusade to bring about a social change of some kind, each individuals effort addsonly about 1% to the whole. Its doubtful that any such endeavor is won or lost by anadditional 1% of effort. Consequently, the individuals participation becomesirrelevant to the outcome.Whether he goes out to work hard or stays home in bed, the outcome will be thesame. In such a situation, theres a strong incentive to stay in bed.The popular answer to such reasoning is Yes, but what if everyone thought thatway? But he isnt everyone; hes only him. He isnt deciding for everyone; hesmerely evaluating the significance of his own actions  and when he works in a group,his actions dont contribute much.Sometimes this realization will cause an individual to drop out of a groupentirely. More often it will simply cause him to work less  to make small decisionshere and there in favor of relaxing as opposed to overdoing it.If the arrangement were such that everything he did had a direct bearing on hisown rewards, be would have a continual incentive to extend his efforts. Hed beencouraged to work harder than he would have worked under the group arrangement.The more directly individual rewards are tied to individual achievements, the greaterincentive there is to increase ones individual effort.Joint EffortsJoint efforts are possible. In fact, theyre necessary to increase standards ofliving. You cant produce your own automobile from scratch  nor can you reallyproduce much of anything without relying upon the efforts of others. You46Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldneed tools, materials, and information; and you cant produce all those thingsyourself.This problem is solved by what is called the specialization of labor. When someindividuals spend all their working time producing a single product, while othersspecialize in producing other products, the result is greater production of all products.The specialization of labor has made it possible for many more things to be availableto everyone.But each person must retain control of his own responsibilities, efforts, andrewards if the maximum incentive is to be maintained. Otherwise, his efforts will be lesssignificant and therefore less productive.Its necessary to exchange with others to acquire whatever you need along theway, but you dont have to enter into sharing agreements of the kind describedearlier. Its more efficient to separate responsibilities and rewards, not share them.The Group Trap is the assumption that greater strength can be achieved bysharing. Just the opposite happens: Individual objectives are watered down, time andeffort are wasted in arranging compromises, and individual incentive is reduced.The individual becomes much less flexible and mobile, because he must deal withothers before getting on with the task at hand. As Thoreau said, The man who goesalone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait till that other isready.6The Group TrapThe Group Trap comes packaged in many wrappings. In its broadest form, it is anyeconomic system that separates achievements from rewards. If an individual isrequired to share what he produces but can also have a share of what others produce,his obvious incentive will be to produce as little as possible and live off the rewardsproduced by others. Consequently, total production will be reduced and there will beless to split up.The Group Trap also applies to a combined effort to clean up the community,lower taxes, end pollution, stop prejudice, accomplish social reforms, promote anideology, or stop a war. In each case, the individuals efforts become almost irrelevant tothe outcome.Its an example of the Group Trap when someone says, If we all stick togetherand follow this plan, well succeed. You wont all stick together; youll each do thingsin your own individual way. Youll depend for your success uponThe Group Trap476Walden by Henry David Thoreau, page 87.others sticking to the plan  and you may wind up spending most of your timefutilely trying to herd them into line.And youll probably recognize that you could sit at home and not change theoutcome one bit  or you could work very hard and still not change the outcome onebit. Your actions are only your actions, not those of the group.Further examples of the Group Trap are business partnerships, profit-sharing plans,pooling of resources in marriages, and efforts to set up communes that eliminateindividual incentives.7A more subtle example of the Group Trap is the labor union. Not all individualsjoin labor unions enthusiastically, but those who do assume that theyll be able tomake more money through the combined strength of the union membership.When one recognizes the value of the specialization of labor, it makes sense for anemployee to consider hiring someone to negotiate for him. But when negotiations areconducted collectively, without regard to individual differences in value, theindividuals incentive is sidetracked again.In a unionized job, your wage is determined by factors other than your individualworth, so the chances are that youll be paid too much or too little. Either event hasits consequences.If youre underpaid, youre wasting your time in that job. If youre overpaid, youhave little incentive to grow into new areas of your job or find out what yourecapable of. In addition, you might lose your job if youre getting more than youreworth to the employer. If your pay exactly matches your worth, its purely accidental.Since the pay of each individual in the union is determined by factors other thanhis own achievement, his incentive to produce deteriorates. Once again, the overalloutput is bound to be reduced thereby  which means that the overall reward to beshared wont be as high as it could be.Professional athletes and entertainers are often represented by agents whonegotiate their contracts for them. An agent might represent several athletes to thesame employer, but each individuals contract is individually negotiated. No attemptis made to rely on the group for bargaining power. Consequently, individualincentives are maintained fully, value is encouraged, and rewards are greater.Youre bound to be able to accomplish more for yourself in a situation where youcan increase your reward through your own individual effort.7These early chapters are devoted to pointing out the drawbacks in the normal way of doingthings. Later chapters will offer alternatives that I believe are more effective.48Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldVariationsIn addition to the examples already given, there are numerous variations of theGroup Trap.A typical example is the concept of democracy. If the majority vote of the groupis binding upon all, the individual forfeits his ability to make decisions for himself.Politicians love to declare that the people have chosen for themselves at the polls.But the people dont have a mind; only individuals do. Those who have voted againstthe winner are now under the jurisdiction of someone who doesnt represent them.Even the concept of the majority is often misleading. In any election, manypeople vote against the winner, many others abstain from voting because they realizetheir individual votes are irrelevant to the outcome, and others arent even allowed tovote (but are bound by the outcome). Those who voted for the winner are usually aminority  and even they may have voted only for the least unpleasant alternative.Another variation of the Group Trap is the assumption that youre responsible forpeople who are starving in other parts of the world. You could work for the rest ofyour life to change that  but your effort would never make a noticeable dent in theproblem.Youre in the Group Trap, too, any time you assume that someone can speak onbehalf of anyone but himself. When someone tells you that you owe something toyour country, to what is he referring? Your country consists of more than 200million individuals with different attitudes, desires, activities, and principles. Do youowe it to every one of them to do as each of them wants you to do? What you oweto your country is really what someone wants you to do to please him, but for whichhes unwilling to make it worth your while.In the same way, no one can speak on behalf of all Americans, Negroes,Mexicans, women, or students. The attempt to do so is an attempt to create pressurein favor of what the speaker wants.When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a common statement was Were all toblame for the death of President Kennedy. How can we all be responsible? Doesthat mean that you should personally police the world to be sure that no one ever doesanything that might be considered wrong?In the same way, when someone says, We have the ability to get to the moon, butwe cant even get along with each other, whom is he talking about? I dont know aboutyou, but I dont have the ability to get to the moon; however, I can get along with somepeople. Doesnt he really mean, While some men have learned how to go to the moon,other men (perhaps himself included) dont know how to get along with people?The Group Trap49Types of AlternativesAs you view any situation in which you have a goal, there are basically two typesof alternatives available to you. I call them direct and indirect.A direct alternative is one that requires only direct action by yourself to get adesired result. An indirect alternative requires that you act to make someone else dowhat is necessary to achieve your objective.Once youve seen the positions and attitudes of the other people involved, adirect alternative requires only that you make a decision; an indirect alternativerequires that you change the attitude of one or more other persons so that they willdo what it is you want.For example, suppose you feel your taxes are too high. An indirect alternativewould be to start a campaign to lower the tax rates. A direct alternative would be tolook for ways to avoid having to pay them.Or suppose you belong to a club whose rules and activities have changed to theextent that you no longer enjoy being a member. An indirect alternative would be totry to change the minds of enough members to return the club to the conditions youenjoyed previously. A direct alternative would be to quit the club and find a betterone.Or suppose youre a college student, whos dissatisfied with the curriculumoffered at your school. Examples of indirect alternatives would be to try to influencethe administration to change the curriculum or try to influence higher powers tochange the administration. Examples of direct alternatives would be to find a moreagreeable school or to study the missing subjects on the side.The examples of choices Ive cited arent necessarily the only ones available; theywere cited to illustrate the two types of alternatives from which you can choose. Adirect alternative requires only a decision on your part; an indirect alternative requiresthat you get others to make decisions that would benefit you.You control only yourself. That doesnt mean that its impossible to convincesomeone else to act in a way youd like him to act. But the process of having to hopefor a favorable reaction from someone else makes an indirect alternative less certainthan a direct alternative.When you join a group in hopes of furthering your aims, youre involved in anindirect alternative. Youre hoping that the others in the group will act in ways thatwill further your objectives. But since each of them has his own individual goals andhis own methods, the result will invariably be something quite different from amultiplication of your own strength.50Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThis principle applies whether the group consists of you and one other person oryou and thousands of others. In every case, your objectives and plans are diluted asthey merge with those of the other members of the group.Selling OthersOne of the greatest encouragements to wasted effort is the concept of positivethinking. To say You can do it if youll just believe you can is to try to wish awayreality. In those situations that involve direct alternatives, your own mental attitudecan make quite a difference. But in situations involving indirect alternatives, falseconfidence can induce you to waste your time futilely trying to change others.Its easy to get involved in a group with the assumption that youll work hard topersuade others of the rightness of your ideas. But those others are individual humanbeings  each with his own knowledge, attitude, goals, and plans. Your mentalattitude will have no more effect in changing his nature than his mental attitude couldchange yours.A realistic individual recognizes the identity of each person he deals with. Heknows that he cant change the identity of the other person just by willing it. He takesthe identities of others seriously and then decides what direct alternatives exist for himin view of those identities.That doesnt mean that no one ever changes his ideas or plans. But the changesoccur only when they make sense to the individual  when they are harmonious withhis basic nature.There are occasions when you must sell something to someone else  possiblyeven sell for a living. But an efficient salesman doesnt approach the world with theidea that his persuasive powers could change anyone.Rather, he accepts people as they are and relies upon two talents: (1) his ability tolocate people whose self-interests would be satisfied by his product or service; and (2)his ability to demonstrate to those people the connection between his product and theirself-interest.I realize that many salesmen waste their time trying futilely to persuade anyoneand everyone they meet. But thats why so many salesmen make poor livings for theamount of time they spend at it.The most successful salesmen, explicitly or intuitively, recognize and accept theidentities of the people they deal with. They take seriously their prospects attitudesand objections. And they dont waste their time with inappropriate prospects.Because they realize that they cant sell everyone, theyre more selective in picking thepeople theyll try to sell.The Group Trap51A Key to FreedomThe recognition of the two types of alternatives is one of the most important keys tofreedom. Most people automatically think in terms of indirect alternatives  who mustbe changed, how people must be educated, what others should be doing.Consequently, they spend most of their lives in futile efforts to achieve what cant beachieved  the remaking of others.In any situation, a free individual immediately looks first at the identities of theother people involved and appraises the situation by the simple standard: Is this whatI want for myself? If it isnt, he looks elsewhere. If it is, he relaxes and enjoys thesituation to the maximum  without the problems that most people take for granted.He automatically thinks in terms of direct alternatives. He asks himself, Withthings as they are, what can I do by myself to make things better for myself?Most people usually assume that there arent many direct alternatives, that theonly one available would be to change oneself. But thats because theyre not geared tolooking for them.It can also be because theyre not free to act upon them  because of otherrestrictions in their lives.For example, if youre deep in debt, on a treadmill, and locked in difficult personalsituations, you cant take advantage of the alternatives a free person could use toinsulate himself from high taxes or repressive government. As a result, you couldassume that your only alternative is to join a movement to attempt to lower thegeneral tax rates.In this way, one kind of freedom often depends upon the existence of otherfreedoms. Whichever freedom you miss most, it may be out of reach because of a lackof other freedoms.A free person doesnt need groups, because hes in a position to take advantageof the numerous direct alternatives that require only his decision, not the changing ofothers.Throughout this book well be looking at many traps, issues, and techniques. In everycase, Ill be suggesting direct alternatives that are much easier to employ than the normallyassumed alternatives that require the cooperation of others.Those direct alternatives do not require that you become a hermit, changeyourself, give up things you enjoy, or in any other way sacrifice yourself in order tomake things work. The point is simply that there are numerous ways to improve yoursituation without having to go to the trouble of making others agree with your way ofthinking.52Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIts possible to have relationships with others, contracts with others, businessdealings, and every other form of social activity. But those relationships will be far morerewarding for you if you recognize identities, find those that are compatible, andarrange matters in ways that appeal to the self-interest of each person involved.Easier WaysThe Group Trap is the belief that you can accomplish more by sharingresponsibilities, efforts, and rewards with others than you can by acting on your own.You waste precious time, effort, and money when you attempt to achieve freedomthrough the efforts of a group. You can achieve far more for yourself by using directalternatives to free yourself of government interference, social pressures, and otherconditions that restrict you.If youre not free now, a good deal of your present situation may be the result ofrestrictive relationships  business partnerships, unsound marital arrangements,misguided allegiances to friends or family. In Chapters 18 through 22 Ill suggest waysthat those objectives might be more efficiently achieved.Group endeavors are inefficient because they neutralize incentives by creatingshared responsibilities, efforts, and rewards. You think and decide and act only foryourself. It isnt realistic to believe you can double your thoughts and actions by addingan equal partner, or that you can multiply them a hundred times over by joining alarge group.There are easier ways  ways in which you can go as far as youre willing to andbe rewarded accordingly.Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne, Hetravels the fastest who travels alone.The Group Trap53 Rudyard Kipling7The Government TrapsGovernments play a very important part in most peoples lives. Well over onethird of ones income is spent for various taxes  income taxes, property taxes, salestaxes, import duties  although some of the taxes are paid indirectly through thecosts of products and, thus, not noticed.The significance of government can be demonstrated by a look at any daily newspaperon any day of the week; the coverage given to news concerning governments isoverwhelming.Because of these things, its not surprising that most people turn first to governmentwhenever they become concerned about their freedom. They assume either that thegovernment must do something to help them be free, or that the government isobstructing their freedom. But few people have ever considered exactly what agovernment is  so they keep trying through government to increase their freedomwithout ever understanding their failures.They waste a great deal of their freedom working to affect the government through voting, politics, educating others (who are in turn supposed to affect thegovernment), protesting, etc.Their freedom is wasted because most of the popular assumptions aboutgovernment wont hold up under close examination. I think there are four basicGovernment Traps  popular misconceptions about the nature of government:1. The belief that governments perform socially useful functions thatdeserve your support.2. The belief that you have a duty to obey laws.3. The belief that the government can be counted upon to carry out asocial reform you favor.4. The fear that the government is so powerful that it can prevent youfrom being free.When I was a young man, if anyone had suggested to me that those beliefs weremistaken, I would have been aghast. But today I know they are all misguided.54The subject of government is fascinating. For it has to do with how you and I andeveryone else gets what he wants in daily intercourse with others  and how thatsaffected by governments. A close investigation of the subject can produce surprisingconclusions. So lets take a closer look.The MarketAs weve seen before, all individuals are different  fortunately. Without suchdifferences there would be very little diversity in what is produced; thered be nospecialization of labor. As it is, theres a wide difference in the kinds of workindividuals are willing to do. These differences make many kinds of products andservices available.There are also wide differences in tastes and desires. This, too, is fortunate. Forthese differences make the world orderly. If everyone wanted the same things, wewould all be struggling against each other to acquire what little was available.Diversity is the source of harmony in human relationships. Because our tastes aredifferent, we can exchange with each other in a way that is mutually beneficial. If youand I have exactly the same values, there is no way we can trade. One of us will havewhat each of us wants most  and he wont give it up.With our difference in values, I can trade something to you for something I valuemore. You, on the other hand, will be getting something you want more than whatyoure giving up. Each of us improves his situation without hurting the other.This is a market  a compatibility of values that makes an exchange possible.Literally billions of such markets operate every day  as exchanges are made all over theworld. For example, an employee trades his time and effort for something he wants more money. An employer, meanwhile, trades his money for something he values more the time and effort of the employee.These markets provide the only way to know exactly what individuals reallywant. Only when an individual gives up something he has in an exchange can youknow how much he values the thing he says he desires.Human wants are limitless. We each want a multitude of things  far more thanwe could ever obtain with our limited resources. So to state a desire for somethingdoesnt specify how much that thing is desired by the individual. Only when he offersto give up something in order to get it do we know how much he values it.Will the man who says he wants a yacht be willing to give up his car, his foodbudget for a year, his clothes and furniture  in order to have the money to buy theyacht? Will the person who wants the poor to be fed be willing to goThe Government Trap55without entertainment for six months  in order to raise money to give to the poor?Will the woman who wishes she had more time to spend with her children be willing togive up the womens club, cocktail parties, and bridge  in order to have the time tospend at home?Desires are limitless; resources are limited. These two conditions are the reasonsthat individuals must make choices. Individuals decide how theyll use their limitedresources to satisfy their strongest desires. In doing so, they develop value scales,which we can see only by looking at the exchanges theyre willing to make.Perhaps an individual cant tell you exactly whats on his value scale, but hechooses in accordance with it when faced with a decision. And he chooses that whichhe believes will bring him the most happiness.Meeting PlaceBillions of exchanges take place daily, and theyre expressions of the desires ofbillions of human beings. If we could somehow add up all the desires of all individualsin a given area (or the whole world) and compare that with the products and servicesavailable, we would have the General Market.Not only is it impossible to make such a calculation, but even if we could, itwould be outdated by the time we added up the figures. For the market is constantlychanging. Each individuals values change constantly as he acquires new knowledgeand new resources. And the availability of things to buy is constantly changing asproducers make changes in what they offer to the public.So the General Market constantly changes. But to whatever extent we canobserve it, it represents an accurate expression of what people, in general, arechoosing to do with their available resources.Within the General Market we find a multitude of differences in motivations. Inthe car market, for example, one person buys a big car that satisfies his desires forcomfort, prestige, and mobility. At the same time, another person buys a small car thatgets him where he wants to go with a minimum of expense.What we see as the General Market is the net effect, or trend, created by thesemany different purchases. But no matter what the overall trend, it contains within itnumerous different desires, availabilities, and purchases.Types of TransactionsWithin the General Market there are two basic kinds of exchanges. The mostcommon is a two-sided transaction  one in which each party participates because hewants to.56Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThe possible reasons for entering a two-sided exchange are endless, of course.They include positive decisions made in order to increase ones happiness (such asbuying a better car to drive) and negative decisions that are made because thingswould get worse without them (such as getting the roof fixed to avoid being floodedby rain).In each case, the individual enters the relationship because what is offered is betterthan what he had before. He could have left things as they were, but he prefers not to.In a one-sided transaction, one of the participants forces the other to choosebetween two new alternatives. He introduces violence (or the threat of it) as a way ofmaking the unwilling participant a part of the relationship.A common example is a hold-up. A man points a gun at you and forces you tochoose between violence and losing your money. You would prefer not to have tomake any choice, but youre forced to; you cant leave things as they were.If you have to choose between paying to have your roof fixed and letting it leak,youre in a similar position (you cant leave things as they were before the roofstarted leaking), but your quarrel is with nature. In a hold-up, its another humanbeing whos inflicted the negative decision upon you.If your wife confronts you with the choice of changing your ways or losing her,there too you must make a negative decision. But your participation in the relationshipitself was a voluntary decision (unless it was a shotgun wedding).Only the first example of the three was a one-sided transaction  a relationshipbetween two human beings where one party has used violence to force the other toparticipate.It should be noted, however, that the thief isnt getting something for nothing.He still has to work for what he gets. He gives up his time, takes risks, pays for his gun,and works in other ways. No matter what you want, or how you intend to get it, youhave to pay a price for it.ExchangesWhen we talk of government were talking of something that exists in the GeneralMarket Ive just described. So lets sum up what weve seen of the ways people get whatthey want through the market:1. Nothing is free. To acquire anything requires an expenditure of time,energy, or money. (Not even natural resources can be used without anapplication of effort  whether that be cutting down a tree or pickingup an apple.)The Government Trap572. Anything you want that you cant provide entirely for yourself requiresan exchange with someone else.3. A one-sided transaction doesnt provide a gain for the unwillingparticipant  even if he receives something in return. It wouldnt beone-sided if he valued what he receives more than what he must giveup, for then hed have entered the transaction willingly.4. Whatever an individual does is the highest-valued alternative that hebelieves is available to him.5. At any given time the General Market reflects the consensus of thehighest values the people therein believe possible. As individuals goabout their business, theyre getting the best they know how in theworld as it is.Speeding up HistoryBut some people are impatient. They look about them and get the impression thatthings arent moving as fast as they could be. They want to improve upon the natural,automatic processes of the market.And so they form governments.They hope thereby to make more things available to more people more quickly. Inaddition, they hope to have their lives and property protected for a smaller price thanthey think it would cost without government.The basic mistake is the assumption that with a government they will have morethan what they would have had in the marketplace. The truth is that they wind upwith less. For the government can give you something only by taking away somethingyou wanted more.Its easy to think that government programs add to whats available. But theydont; they replace what was available. And weve already seen that at any given timethe General Market expresses the highest-valued desires of the people within it. So thegovernment can only replace one thing with something valued less.People seek government action because they dont approve of what other peoplechoose to do with their lives. They want to overrule the decisions others have madeconcerning the uses of their own time and money.It generally works this way: The individuals in Group A want something that requiresthe cooperation of Group B. But they cant (or wont) convince Group B that its tothe advantage of Group B. So Group A calls upon the government to pass a law thatcompels Group B to cooperate.58Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldFor example, a few critics want American car manufacturers to build automobileswith more safety accessories than the car makers have chosen to include. The carmakers have decided (wisely or not) that potential car buyers dont want thoseaccessories enough to pay the extra price required.If Group A (the critics) cant convince either Group B (the manufacturers) orGroup C (the buyers) of the importance of the safety additions, they still have somealternatives available. They could refuse to continue buying what they consider to beunsatisfactory cars, or they could publish their findings (if theres enough interest tocreate a market).Instead, they choose to go to the government. They believe they must coercivelyimpose their safety standards upon all car makers and car buyers  regardless ofthose individuals values.If the laws are passed, some buyers may approve, even though they might not buythe new cars when the prices go up. Far more car buyers will be unhappy, becausethey would have preferred less stringent standards and lower prices  which is whythe car makers resisted the higher standards in the first place. Obviously, if theydthought most car buyers wanted to pay more for safer cars, theyd have offered justthat, in order to sell more cars.Enforced ConformityMany people think were protected against dishonesty or inefficiency throughgovernment licensing and inspection requirements. But different individuals wantdifferent kinds and amounts of protection. For example, you might decide not to buysomething until youre assured that its what you expect  by your standards. I, onthe other hand, might hire someone else to protect my interests. A third person mightprefer to risk his money rather than pay the expense of having a product guaranteed.These differences between us pose no problem. Each of us can do as he chooses trusting or not trusting the people we deal with, paying for as much or as littleprotection as we want.When the government intervenes, however, all of us are required to adhere tostandards set by the government  and at a cost dictated by the government. Almostall of us are deprived of the choices we would have preferred.In a world of vastly different tastes, the government imposes one way upon usand forces everyone to adhere to that one way.Despite our differing tastes, the government decides which products wereallowed to buy. Federal agencies rule products out of the market, import quotasprevent other products from being available, and legal monopolies (such as the postalservice or public utilities) prevent us from choosing alternative ways of obtainingservices.The Government Trap59Again, our preferences are overruled and were forced to take what thegovernment has decreed to be best  leaving us without the things we could havehad without government intervention.Government regulation always overrules the consumers. What consumers dontwant, they dont have to buy; what governments dont want, consumers cant buy.What consumers want (protection, inspection, etc.), they can get; what the governmentthinks they should have, consumers are forced to take and forced to pay for.Its important to recognize that these government decisions are not benevolent,kindly forms of advice and help. No, they are enforced by violence. If you should everdecide that your business will continue to provide what consumers want, despitegovernment regulations, youll be met with violence.Youll be fined. If you refuse to pay the fine, your bank accounts will be seized.If you continue to provide what consumers prefer, youll be ordered to close yourbusiness. If you resist, gentlemen with guns will take you to jail.Absolutely every government regulation is enforced by violence. If youve neverseen that violence, its because youve been careful, obedient, or lucky. Wouldregulations still be obeyed if the police, courts, and jails were dissolved?Government BusinessesThe same principles apply when governments set up businesses  schools,lending institutions, insurance companies, or foreign-aid programs, etc. Its claimedthat society needs them and the free market wont, or cant, provide them.But who is society if not the same people who are already expressing their needsand preferences in the marketplace? If they arent willing to pay for the service in thefree market (the General Market apart from the government), who can say theyreeager to pay for it through government?Who will provide the resources (time, energy, and money) to pay for theservices? Obviously, the cost will be borne by the same people whove already chosento do other things with their resources. The government cant create resources out ofthin air any more than you or I can. The resources will have to come from peoplewhod rather use them for something else.Since theres no justification for that, various arguments are presented todemonstrate the value of government enterprises.For example, its often said that a government business will pay its own way meaning that consumers will buy its services at prices sufficient to pay itsexpenses. Why, then, bother to call upon the government? If the service were trulyable to pay its own way, it would be profitable for someone to offer it in the60Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldmarketplace. If no one has, it means only that no one really believes it can pay its ownway.The next argument claims that the government can offer the service withoutmaking a profit. But what is a profit? Its simply a net gain a person receives for thetime, energy, and money hes expended. Will the workers in a government businessdonate their time and energies without pay? Obviously not.Perhaps whats meant is that there wont be any profit earned on the moneyinvested. But that means someones going to have his money confiscated andinvested in a government business without getting the profit he could have madeinvesting it in the free market.Its also claimed there will be no entrepreneurial profit  meaning no one will bepaid for appraising the market to determine the desire for the service, putting theorganization together, and making sure it will run right. But who will make sure thebusiness is sound?If the government claims it can do away with profit, it means either that (1) therehas been no appraisal of the market potential for the service; or that (2) the appraisalhas been done by someone whos grossly underpaid and thus not to be relied upon; orthat (3) the necessary appraisal has been stolen from someone else; or that (4) theappraisal is being paid for with other government funds that wont show up on theledgers of the enterprise.In any case, the nonprofit claim is of no benefit to the public.No matter what the argument, the conclusion is the same: The government hasno mysterious ability to do things that cant be done in the free market. It cantcommand resources that dont already exist.It can only overrule the decisions of its citizens  eliminating their alternativesand replacing those alternatives with activities theyve desired less. It takes money fromthe General Market and spends it on less-valued choices, adding the cost of itself inthe process, and leaving people with less than they would have if there were nogovernment.Any individual in the General Market can give to the poor, pay for someoneelses schooling, donate money to foreign governments, or hire protection. It isnt hischoice hes concerned about when he wants the government to do those things. Itssomeone elses choice that hes trying to overrule.All government actions depend upon one-sided transactions, in which anindividual is forced to choose between paying for what he doesnt want and going tojail.These principles apply to any government  from the local school board to thefederal government.Governments dont rule; they overrule.The Government Trap61Why Governments?Why, then, do governments have such widespread acceptance? I canthink of three reasons:1. Most people believe that governments add to the general well-being, rather thanreduce it. They havent recognized the simple economic truths weve covered here.2. Many individuals believe theyre getting more benefits from the government thanthey give up. They pay a price in taxes and reduced alternatives (many of which they maynot have recognized), but feel that they get back more in subsidies and special privileges.In other words, they dont think that society benefits but believe that they,individually, come out ahead. As Frederic Bastiat put it, The State is the great fictitiousentity by which everyone expects to live at the expense of everyoneelse.8The same attitude can apply in non-financial matters. A person may be pleased withlaws that keep others from smoking marijuana or buying what they want or associatingwith whomever they choose. Hes glad to see the government imposing his tastes uponeveryone else.3. The last-ditch argument for government is that its necessary for the protectionof life and property. Its easy to assume that without government wed be at the mercy ofthieves, rapists, and murderers. How would you protect yourself if there were nogovernment?Chances are youd protect yourself by locking your doors, staying out ofdangerous areas, keeping your children away from situations where they cant protectthemselves, and choosing whom youll allow in your home.Sound familiar?It should, for thats probably what youre doing already.Governments dont protect you. They cant. All they can do is promise to makethe person who hurts you pay for his crime  if they can catch him. The criminalwont pay you back, of course, so they punish him only as a deterrent to future crime. Ifyou think the deterrent is working, why is crime always such a public issue?Occasionally, a government policeman actually prevents a specific crime fromtaking place or from being completed. The odds against that are tremendous,however. If you want to eliminate all risk of violence, your only recourse is to pay fora guard to watch over you and your property day and night.62Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World8From the essay The State  included in Selected Essays on Political Economy, page144.And if thats what you want, you can hire a guard to do it  but the price youalready pay to the government wont purchase him.Small wonder that the Los Angeles Chief of Police advised residents to bar theirdoors, buy a police dog, call us when were available, and pray as the best methodsof protecting themselves from crime.9Enter the SyndicateTheres no way an individual can escape having to protect himself  with orwithout a government. But its assumed that no one person can protect himselfagainst whats called organized crime  the Mafia or other syndicates. How canan individual cope with a problem so large?Why not? No individual could build a shopping center by himself, since thematerials must be obtained from hundreds of remote places around the world andthousands of operations are required to build the buildings. Somehow, though, thejob gets done through the voluntary actions of literally millions of people throughoutthe world. And no one has to be coerced to make it possible.If governments didnt coercively monopolize the market for protection, theredundoubtedly be more forms of protection offered on a voluntary basis to those whofeel threatened by organized crime.But lets assume for the moment that individuals would be helpless againstorganized crime if the government didnt protect them. We could paint a pretty grimpicture of the Mafias effect upon our lives.What is it we fear would happen if the Mafia were unrestrained by thegovernment? Here are some of the problems we assume wed face:1. So-called protection rackets would flourish. Businessmen wouldhave to pay tribute to the Mafia or be violently put out of business.2. Extortion would run rampant. You might have to pay off the Mafia inorder to prevent being pushed around, or for the privilege of getting ajob.3. If worst came to worst, you might even have to pay off the syndicatejust to be allowed to remain on your own property. If so, youd neverown anything outright; youd always have to pay someone for theprivilege of keeping what you thought was yours.The Government Trap639Los Angeles Times, June 4, 1971.4. The syndicate might even tell you where you could work, or whereyoud have to work, or how to run your business, or what kind ofservices theyd let you offer, or perhaps theyd even prevent you fromcompeting with their businesses. Who could stop them?5. And they might take the profits from their rackets and use them tocompete with your business  using your own money to cut intoyour market.Thats a pretty grim picture. Would you want to live in such an environment?Youd have to pay for the privilege of working, going into business, staying on yourown property. Youd be told what you couldnt do in your relationships withcustomers and friends. And you might even have to finance your own competitors.And So . . .To prevent that nightmare from becoming a reality, we have a government. Andwhat does the government do?1. It imposes corporation taxes, license fees, and sales taxes upon businessmen coercively shutting down any business that doesnt pay.2. It seizes income taxes as payment for the privilege of working.3. It gives you the one-sided choice of paying property taxes or losing yourproperty. So, as economist F. A. Harper has pointed out, you dont actually ownanything; you rent from the government. Sales between individuals are onlyexchanges of the privilege of renting property from the government. He who doesntpay the annual rental is forcibly evicted from his property.4. The government decrees what products you can offer to your customers(through the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies) and how much you cancharge for your services (setting both minimum and maximum limits for wages andprices), requires massive bookkeeping, and imposes many other rules upon yourbusiness or your employment. And if it gets into trouble with other governments, itcan even enslave you in its army to fight, and possibly die, on its behalf.The government delegates some of its coercive powers to labor unions which, inturn, prevent many people from working at jobs where theyd otherwise be employedon a mutually profitable basis.The government will prevent you from going into the business of delivering first-class mail  even though prior to that law private postal companies delivered themail for a lower price, gave faster service, and made profits for themselves.64Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAnd if that werent enough, try starting your own phone company.5. On top of all this, the government uses the money it takes from you to operatebusinesses that may be in competition with your own. It has mortgage companies, ladiesunderwear factories, charities, print shops, laundries, and hundreds more. Since it canalways come back to you to cover its losses, it usually charges less for its products thanyou have to charge to stay in business.So to protect you from the crime syndicates, the government makes you paytribute for the privileges of working, going into business, or staying on your own property.It dictates the terms of your relationships with customers and friends. It finances yourcompetitors with your money. And it can even enslave you in its army.What could the Mafia do that would be worse?Its important to realize that a two-sided transaction is no threat to you. Ifsomeone offers you something, you can turn it down. And, surprisingly, most of thecrime the government presumes to protect us against are two-sided transactions thegovernment doesnt approve of.For example, the U.S. News & World Report claims that the total yearly takefrom organized crime is $19.7 billion.10 But a closer look at the figures indicates thatless than a billion dollars of that is in crimes of violence. Over 90% of the total is intwo-sided transactions like gambling, loan-sharking, alcohol, prostitution, and drugs.You can simply decline to participate in any of that.In addition, much of the governments law enforcement is devoted topreventing free market transactions between willing participants  enforcement offair competition laws, licensing laws, etc.And to do this, the government imposes a one-sided transaction upon you.Surprisingly, you can avoid most of what is labeled crime by a simple choice not toparticipate. But youre not given the choice to avoid participating with the protector.Since you already pay separately for the things that actually protect you (locks,alarm systems, insurance, watch dogs, etc.), would protection be much moreexpensive if there were no government?National DefenseWhat about national defense? Isnt the nation safe from foreign enemies onlybecause of the government?What is a nation? In common usage, a nation is considered to be a geographicalarea under the jurisdiction of a single government that isnt aThe Government Trap6510U.S. News & World Report, October 26, 1970, p. 30.subdivision of a larger government. The government assumes responsibility for thedefense of the geographical area and makes all decisions regarding armed conflictwith outsiders.If there were no government, thered be no nation. And if there were no nation,thered be nothing to defend.If that sounds too simple, think about it. No aggressor conquers a nation byovercoming every single inhabitant and occupying every part of the geographical area. Itwould be far too expensive to do so.Instead, the aggressor applies force against the country until the government of thatnation surrenders. Then the aggressor takes over the existing governmental machinery toenforce the occupation. If no such machinery existed, how could it enforce theoccupation?Hitler couldnt have conquered Europe without the help provided by the governmentsof the occupied nations. Would he have sent every one of his Nazis into Norway topolice all the Norwegians? If he had, who would have been left at home to police theGermans?That doesnt mean that aggression would stop if there were no governments. Butthe aggression would be no more formidable than the examples of crime wevealready covered.Hydrogen bombs and other modern tools of war are effective only when they can beused to pressure governments. Enemy rulers have nothing to gain by destroying U.S.property and people  except as a means of pressuring the government to surrender.Otherwise, the more they destroy, the less value to them in conquering the nation.If there were no federal government in the U.S., the Communists would have toconquer fifty different state governments  which would be far more difficult. Butwhat if there were no state governments? Then theyd have to conquer every townseparately.But what if there were no town governments  no governments at all? Thentheyd have to make over 200 million separate conquests  and use millions of theirown policemen to set up new governments.Obviously the answer to the threat of communism (or any other enemy) is not astronger government to defend us but just the opposite. Wed be far safer if there wereno government to conquer.Its surprising how many national issues, problems that cry out forgovernment intervention, wouldnt even exist if there were no governments.The dictators of the world have always operated in countries where there was astrong respect for government. The prevailing European awe of the state hasproduced an endless number of tyrants, wars, and low standards of living.66Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAnd now that generations of Americans have been taught that governments arevital to their well-being, present-day Americans are afflicted with all the problems thatinvariably result from big government.Such a trend has developed over many lifetimes; it wont be reversed within ours.Governments grow naturally because individuals see them as ways of increasingtheir rewards at lower expense. Its an over simplification to say that people wantsomething for nothing. All people want to obtain as much as possible for as littleeffort as possible; thats why labor-saving devices are valuable.Unfortunately, however, government isnt the labor-saving device it appears tobe. It always gives back less than it takes. But because it does appear to be a giver ofgood things, its appeal is almost universal and there isnt much likelihood that thetrend will be reversed.The Government TrapsLets take another look now at the four Government Traps:Trap #1: The belief that governments perform socially useful functions thatdeserve your support. If all the individual gains or losses caused by an act could betotaled, the net total would be the social effect. While this could never be tabulated,weve seen logically that any governmental activity will provide less than what theGeneral Market has already made available  when everyones values are taken intoconsideration. The governments services replace services that had been valued morehighly by the General Market.Trap #2: The belief that you have a duty to obey laws. The obligation to obeylaws is a good example of one person trying to manipulate another through the useof moral dictums. Your obedience doesnt even perform a socially useful function; itonly enhances coercion and disorder.The only relevant consideration is the personal consequence to you: what youwill gain if you break a law versus the loss imposed upon you if youre caught,together with the degree of risk that youll be caught. If you choose to obey a law, itshould be because of the consequences to you  not because you have anobligation.Trap #3: The belief that the government can be counted upon to carry out asocial reform you favor. Even if youre willing to try to use the government for yourown purposes, it isnt likely to bring about the changes you seek.Any government program can be made to sound promising at the time itsintroduced, but just look back over the past twenty years or so to see what the actualresults have been.The Government Trap67The foreign aid that was going to save the world from communism has actuallybeen used to enrich various nations before they fell to the Communists  Cuba,China, Eastern Europe, etc. And its been used to finance both sides of the wars inVietnam, the Dominican Republic, and other places.Back in 1964, the government started promising an early end to the VietnamWar, but the promises and realities were far, far apart.At home, look at the many housing projects that were going to do away with slums.Where can a government point to a slum-free big city as proof of its effectiveness?Remember the War on Poverty? The Alliance for Progress? The Full EmploymentAct of 1946? Grand dreams, lots of money spent, no success.Governments have a consistent record of failure in their endeavors. Even if yourewilling to force others to pay for what you want, no government is going to solve theecology problems, make women professional equals, prevent monopolies, or fulfill anyother objective you may have in mind.Working through government to get what you want is a classic example of anindirect alternative. The success of your plans depends far more upon what otherpeople do than upon your own decisions. First you have to rally public support so thatCongress will act; then you must hope that the President and the bureaucracy willcarry out the plan as you intended it. You have to go through thousands of people toget to your objective.Whatever it is you want, theres bound to be a direct alternative available thatrequires only your own decision. If there are people you want to aid, for example, youcan accomplish far more by keeping the taxes and paying the money directly to thosepeople.The government cant carry out your plans for you, but you can.Trap #4: The fear that the government is so powerful that it can prevent youfrom being free. Weve seen in this chapter the principles upon which a government isorganized. It attempts to overrule the General Market and inflict its way uponindividuals.Fortunately, the government is subject to the same market principles that we are.Its resources are limited, so it cant hope to enforce its laws adequately by policingevery person individually.The government is organized as one gigantic Group Trap. Since it cant escapethe consequences of a mistaken policy (any more than we can), it operates veryineffectively.Many people think things would be better if the government were only more efficient.Happily, it isnt. For collectively, we are free to the extent that the government isinefficient and unable to carry out its coercive programs. And68Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldindividually, you are free to the extent that you take advantage of the governmentsinefficiency.11What Is Government?The Government Traps ensnare many people because they never stop torecognize what a government is. Its an agency of coercion thats accepted asnecessary by most people within its area of influence. It differs from the Mafia onlyin that the Mafia isnt usually considered necessary by the people in the communitiesit serves.Governments usually do enjoy that respect. Even those people who want theins replaced by the outs consider the institution itself to be necessary.I dont expect to see a world in which there would be no theft, aggression, orcoercion. But it would be refreshing to live in one in which no agency of coercion hadthe acceptance of most of the people around me. Dealing with an agency of coercionwould be much easier if you didnt have to cope also with law-abiding neighborswho act as unpaid functionaries of the state.I believe a world without government would be a better place to live. However,that doesnt tell me how to deal with the world in which I do live.But a realistic understanding of government keeps you out of the GovernmentTraps. You wont waste precious time and energy trying to work through thegovernment to become free. Nor will you allow blind allegiance or patriotism to keepyou from living your life as you want to live it. Nor will you be deterred by thegovernments apparent powers.Theres nothing to be gained by trying to make the government more efficient, bytrying to get the bad guys out and the good guys in. The government has nothingto offer you.The Government Trap6911Well look at the techniques for doing that in Chapter 16.And therein lies the answer to the famous clich, The government should do forthe people only what they cannot do for themselves.Theres nothing the government can do for you that you cant do for yourself  farless expensively, far more easily, and far more securely. And you can do it for yourselfwithout first having to obtain the approval of the electorate, the establishment, oranyone else.The art of government consists in taking as much money aspossible from one class of citizens to give to the other. Voltaire70Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World8The Despair TrapThe Despair Trap is the belief that other people can prevent you from being free.Despair isnt hard to come by. If youve been trying to create a freer climate inthe nation, youve probably accumulated plenty of reasons to be despondent. Or ifyouve been trying to convince your friends and family to accept your way of life, youprobably feel very misunderstood and unappreciated by now. Or if youve been tryingto smooth out difficult relationships with your lover, business associates, or relatives,you may be about ready to throw in the towel.There are many things that can make you feel that youre an alien in the world,one who will never be understood.Siegmund, a character in Richard Wagners opera Die Walkre, summed it upwell: Whatever I thought right, to others seemed wrong; what I held to be bad,others approved of.Despite these kinds of problems, the goals of freedom and happiness are totallyrealistic. If they arent being achieved, its the method thats wrong, not the objective.You have to accept the world as it is. But that doesnt mean you should look at thepeople who oppose your ways and conclude that theres no chance to be free. Theworld includes much more than just the people youve been dealing with.There are undoubtedly many, many people with whom you have nothing incommon. But there are also plenty of people who see things in much the same wayyou do. If you havent come in contact with them, it may be because youveunnecessarily confined yourself to those with whom youve been associating.And it may be that you havent discovered ways of finding the kinds of peoplewho could add to your life, instead of detract from it.Theres no one in this world exactly like you. But there are undoubtedly peoplewho want many of the same things you do, people who look at things in much thesame way you do, and people who want what you have to offer.The popular conventions of society might discourage you from breaking out ofuncomfortable situations to find those people. Such hallowed traditions as one71marriage, one career, one employer, staying in one place, etc., can cause you to feelthat you must make the best of whatever situation youre already in.But making the best frequently means either giving up your own happiness or tryingto change others. Neither way makes any sense.You dont have to stay where you are. You can look for someone who doesnthave to be forced to love you, someone who will be enthusiastic about what you haveto offer, someone who will help you get what you want because it will be in his self-interest to do so.The Despair TrapYoure in the Despair Trap if you believe that you have to stay where you are andwork things out somehow. Or if you believe that you couldnt be any better off if youwere to change your situation. Or if you think that the government or society can stopyou from being free.Youre in the Despair Trap if you think youll always be poor because you comefrom a family thats always been that way. Or when you feel that love relationshipsmust always deteriorate into uneasy compromises. Or when you believe that peopledont appreciate good products, good ideas, or good individuals.Youre in the trap when you think there are too many complications in your life tobe able to break out from where you are. Or when you think that freedom andhappiness are overrated myths.A Market for YouThe General Market embraces personal relationships as well as commercial ones.All relationships are governed by market principles as individuals come together,exchange or share as appropriate, and work toward the advancement of their ownhappiness. The same principles apply to finding a friend that apply to finding a buyerfor your product.Within the General Market theres a whole world of potential relationships for youif you realize that you dont have to please everyone.If you want a marriage partner whos compatible with your way of life, you donthave to prove to everyone that your way is right. You need to find only one person whomeets your needs and who wants you as you are.You dont need millions of friends; you only need enough to provide thecompanionship and shared interests youd like to have. So it isnt important what theother people are like.72Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldLet me illustrate this with a commercial example. General Motors is theacknowledged giant of the automobile industry; its success is often discussed. Its namehas become a symbol of bigness and domination. Some people think it controls themarket; others think it must be doing everything right and pleasing everyone.How big and successful is it?In a typical year General Motors will sell around four million new cars. With over 200million individuals in the U.S., it sells new cars to about 2% of the population. Someindividuals will buy new GMC cars, others will buy other brands, others will buy usedcars, and most of them wont buy any cars at all.Only 2%! Yet by tapping such a small percentage of the market, General Motorspays a dividend every year to its stockholders and high salaries to the people who runit. With such a small share of the market, its profits are enormous. It is a success.But what if GMCs executives decided they should be able to sell cars toeveryone? Suppose they increased their advertising budget and flooded the marketwith sales appeals designed to get everyone to buy a new car. Suppose they madeimpassioned sales appeals to widows on Social Security, desert prospectors, littlechildren, and invalids.Obviously, the company would be broke in no time. And probably one of theexecutives would go home and grumble over his martini, The world is no damn good;people dont appreciate what were trying to do for them.Its just as foolish to feel that you must make everyone understand that youreright, that your desires are legitimate, that you should be able to do as you want. Youdont have to. Just concentrate your attention (as General Motors does) on findingthose people who are appropriate for you. You can ignore the others.In Chapter 17 Ill suggest ways that you can find the people who represent yourbest market.In the meantime, recognize that the market youre dealing with now is only a smallpart of the whole. Out there in the world are many different kinds of people. Andamong them are people you can work with, love with, associate with, make friendswith. They are people to whom your ideas and ways and desires are the best possible.In addition, there are people who dont want you to be free. They may notapprove of your going your own way. They may want to censure you, attack you, taxyou. But there are ways of handling them, too, as well see.Dont focus on indirect alternatives and think you get what you want only bychanging those around you. There are numerous opportunities that require onlyThe Despair Trap73your decision. There are plenty of compatible, attractive people who will gladly offeryou what you want.Dont be depressed by what others say about your freedom and happiness. Theyarent the whole world, and they dont have all the answers. There is a better world tofind when youre free to look for it.Little souls wish you to be unhappy. It aggravates them to have youjoyous, efficient and free. They like to feel that fate is disciplining you.It gives their egos wings if yours are clipped. You can ruin your life inan hour by listening to their puerile opinions.74Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World David Seabury9The Rights TrapThe Rights Trap is the belief that your rights will make you free.Its not hard to fall into this trap and become preoccupied with your rights as a way ofgetting what you want. Youve probably heard since childhood that you have certainrights  to life, liberty, property, the freedom to pursue your happiness.In addition, its easy to feel that someone owes you certain things in a relationship such as respect, honesty, or fair play.Unfortunately, rights exist only in theory. In practice, they dont accomplish much no matter how much people may discuss them.By implication, a right to something means that someone else must provide thatsomething, whether or not he wants to. A right to your property, for instance, means thatyou should be allowed to keep your property  even if others want to take it. A right toa job means that someone must provide a job for you even if he prefers not to.Rights are invoked only when theres a conflict of interest. Otherwise, theres noneed for them.One reason its so easy to walk into the Rights Trap is that it sometimes seems tobe the only way to deal with a conflict. But thats only one of three methods ofhandling such situations. You can:1. 1. Rely upon your rights to get you what you want.2. 2. Find a way to make it in the other persons self-interest to providewhat you want.3. 3. Find a way of getting what you want without his being involved.In my experience, Ive been involved in many situations in which the second or the thirdmethod has worked for me. But Ive never found a situation in which the first methodhas been useful.Weve seen that an individual acts in ways he believes will provide the mosthappiness for himself, based upon his own knowledge of the alternatives available.Hell do what you want him to do only when he thinks thats the best75alternative for him. If he thinks there are better alternatives for him, he wont do whatyou want.Its as simple as that.Using your RightsLets see how the alternatives apply to various matters in which rights are ofteninvoked.Its popularly assumed that you have a right to your life. Unfortunately however,if someone kills you, your right is of little value. The police may investigate, may evenfind the killer, may even take him to court and convict him, may even execute him.But none of that will change the fact that youre dead.Obviously, its more effective to see to it that no one has both the intention andthe opportunity to kill you.Another right thats often discussed is your right to your property. But onceagain, what use is that right if your property is stolen? Stolen property is rarelyrecovered by the police and returned intact to its owner.Whether or not you have a right, you still have to protect your property or risklosing it. Its more effective to make it difficult for a thief to steal it  so that it willbe in his self-interest to go elsewhere.Its often said that everyone has a right to a job or to a decent standard ofliving. But who will gladly give up his own happiness to make that possible? If its inan employers self-interest to hire you, hell do so; if not, your right wont get you ajob.The fact that governments claim to protect these rights is insignificant. There are stillmurders, thefts, and unemployed people  as well as arsons, rapes, and uneducatedpeople who had a right to an education.Whether or not there are fewer problems as a result of laws isnt relevant. Theystill happen  and if they happen to you, its no comfort that they happen less oftento others.In the same way, your rights offer little protection against the government itself.You can feel that the government doesnt have a right to tax you more than a certainamount. But unfortunately, the government probably does tax you more than you thinkis fair.Many people believe the Constitution should protect their rights. But has it doneso?Ive heard it said that the Constitution is perfect but that the politicians createproblems by ignoring it. But if the Constitution cant make the politicians respect it, ofwhat value is it? Its interesting to talk about, but not really useful to76Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldyour freedom. For, in practice, the Constitution is whatever the President, theCongress, and the Supreme Court choose to think it is  and that may beconsiderably different from what you think it is.If a law is passed to protect your rights, its an uncertain, temporary safeguard atbest. Laws are broken, amended, repealed, overruled, ignored, and ill-enforced.Theyre not very effective protectors.Personal RelationshipsIn personal relationships, its easy to fall into the habit of expecting others to treat youas you think you should be treated. But thats a form of the Identity Trap.Each person you deal with will treat you as his knowledge and understandingguide him  whether he be a friend or stranger.Its ineffectual to insist upon moral conduct, respect, or courtesy. The otherperson wont forsake his own way in order to accommodate you. Even if you can proveby argument that he should, hell respond only reluctantly and your victory willbe of little practical value.Sometimes, you can feel youre merely trying to point out that its in his self-interest toact as you suggest. But again, he wont necessarily agree  even if youre right.Its more realistic, and far less trying, simply to allow each person to be what hewants to be, while you look for people who already are what you want them to be.A great burden was lifted from my shoulders the day I realized that noone owes me anything. For as long as Id thought that there were certainthings I was entitled to, Id been wearing myself out trying to collectthem.No one owes me moral conduct, respect, friendship, love, courtesy, orintelligence. And since Ive recognized that, all my relationships havebeen far more satisfying. Ive made it a point to be involved with peoplewho want to do the very things I want them to do.That understanding has served me well in dealings with friends, businessassociates, lovers, sales prospects, and strangers. It constantly reminds me that I canget what I want only if Im willing to enter the other persons world. I have to try tounderstand how he thinks, what he believes to be important, what he wants. Only thencan I appeal to him in ways that will bring me what I want.The Rights Trap77And only then can I tell whether I really want to be involved with him. Thatmakes it much easier to save the important relationships for those with whom I havethe most in common.The Rights TrapThe Rights Trap is the belief that your rights can get you what you want. Yourein the trap any time you count on anything other than an individuals selfinterest to causehim to give you what you want.Youre in the Rights Trap if you assume that an effective statement of your rightswill bring you lower taxes, more personal freedom, or an end to injustice. Thoseobjectives are realistic  but youre much more likely to get them if you forget aboutyour rights and utilize other tools.You can also fall backward into the Rights Trap by letting someone else pressureyou by invoking his rights. His rights are as theoretical as yours. And you will lookfor ways to circumvent them, just as he would. But its possible to be affectedemotionally by his demands if you dont recognize that theyre pointless.Its in your self-interest to be aware of the consequences of your actions. Ifyouve made a promise, you can expect bad consequences if you break it. But youshould focus your attention on those consequences, not on his concern with his rights.In fact, this is where confusion can develop. If such things as lying, stealing, or killingwould bring you bad consequences, your reasons can be confused with questions ofrights.For example, suppose youve decided that stealing would bring you badconsequences. If someone tells you that by not stealing youre recognizing propertyrights, you might also react to someones claim of a right to a decent living as ifthe context were similar  and you might think you have a duty to satisfy that right.The consequences to you, not someones conception of rights, must always be thedeciding standard of your actions.VulnerabilityPerhaps there are times when you feel that your rights are the only weapon youhave in a dispute. If so, it usually indicates that youve made yourself vulnerable tosomeone whose self-interest conflicts with yours.It helps to remember that you are the one who put yourself in the vulnerableposition. You have chosen to associate with those who cause you problems 78Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldwhether they be your family, your business associates, your employer, youremployees, or your friends.If youre not being treated as you want to be treated, its your vulnerability thatmust be changed. You could spend the rest of your life trying to educate the others,to change their natures and values, to get them to respect your rights. But youprobably wouldnt succeed.It always makes more sense to concentrate on the direct alternatives  the thingsyou do control. What others do is up to them, but theres always a great deal you cando. Choose from the alternatives that require only your decision  not from amongthe many hopes that someone will be something other than what he is.To rely on your rights or on your ability to change others is far less promisingthan to rely upon yourself.The Great Milk RobberyTo illustrate this, lets suppose that I walk out to my front porch one morning,expecting to pick up my milk. But lo and behold, I find that its been stolen. What doI do next?I can bitterly feel that the thief had no right to steal from me. But would that getmy milk back?I could stand on the front porch and deliver an eloquent speech, cursing thedisgraceful fact that there are thieves in the world. But what would that get me aside from a few angry neighbors?To say that there are thieves in the world is only to repeat what Ive known allalong. To say that its disgraceful is to say that if I were God, Id have made theworld differently. But since Im not God, that point is irrelevant, too.To say that I would never steal someones milk is to acknowledge that Imdifferent from many of the people in the world and that I have my own way of tryingto achieve happiness. But why should I expect someone else to use my way?The only area of interest is that which I control. Ive decided to risk theft byhaving the milk bottles left on the front porch. And I can decide to continue that riskor have the milk handled in some other way.If I concentrate on the thiefs immorality or on my rights, Im probably leavingmyself vulnerable to another theft. But if I use what I control to make newarrangements, I can see to it that the theft isnt repeated  and that shouldbe my major concern.12The Rights Trap7912And I can think about that while Im pouring water on my Wheaties.Your ControlYou have so much control over your life, it would be a shame to throw it away.But you do just that if you hope to get what you want by involving your rights or bytrying to change others.By using the control you do have, you can reduce your taxes, adopt the life styleyou want, and establish valuable relationships that wont bring problems. There arenumerous direct alternatives available to you  many of which will be suggested as wego along.No one owes you anything; everyone you deal with will choose the best alternativesfor himself.Try forgetting about your rights. They havent made you free. They didnt bring youthe good things youve achieved in your life. Why count on them in the future?There are far easier ways to get what you want.We are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that write whatmen do, and not what they ought to do. Francis BaconMight is a fine thing, and useful for many purposes; for one goesfurther with a handful of might than with a bagful ofright.80Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World Max Stirner10The Utopia TrapThe Utopia Trap is the belief that you must create better conditions in societybefore you can be free.Its a very basic, very understandable belief. Its easy to see that other people arearranging things incorrectly  passing the wrong laws, misinterpreting things, evenmaliciously arranging things to the detriment of others. You can see poverty, repression,prejudice, and other conditions that stifle creativity and happiness.Its easy to feel that society needs an overhaul (major or minor) before youll be ableto live freely. As a result, you can devote a great deal of effort to attempts to make othersunderstand what you see, to the passing of laws, to a quest for a better society.While youre doing this, you obviously give up a great deal of time and other resourcesthat could have been used to enjoy life. But its assumed that once the proper overhaulof society is completed, youll be able to live more freely.There are two basic reasons why I dont get involved in the quest to changesociety: (1) because its an indirect alternative, its a much harder, more permanentjob than most people realize; and (2) it isnt necessary. An individual doesnt need tolive in a free society in order to free himself  and when he tries to change the world, hesin for a lot more trouble than he may have bargained for.Lets look first at the scope of the job involved in bringing about social change.Separate WorldsIf you think you know the truth about a given situation, its very easy to assumethat all you have to do is point it out to another person. So naturally youre amazedwhen he doesnt quickly agree with you and do what you want. But here we are backin the Identity Trap again.Its hard to realize that you live in a world of your own  bounded by your ownknowledge, your own perception, your own ways of reasoning, your own set ofstandards. And that other person doesnt reside there. He lives in his own world.81Sometimes your worlds will overlap; with some people, theyll overlap often. Butmost of each persons world is different from yours. What is obvious to you may seemvery strange to him. You can base a plan on making him see the light, but the plan canvery easily go astray.And if its difficult to influence just one person, think what youre up against whenyou hope to change the prevailing views of a whole society of people.Do you know what you face? Do you understand each of the individual natures ofthe thousands or millions of people youd have to convert to make your ideal societypossible? Will your statement of the truth be sufficient to make each of them give up hisown way of seeking happiness and follow your way?This doesnt mean that the world never changes  for better or for worse. Itchanges constantly. But what we see as a changing world is the result of millions ofindividual changes that add up to a net change in the General Market. The generalchange is a result of many specific individual changes.You can look through history and see examples where it appears that one personhas brought about great social change. And that can lead you to think that you can do thesame if you work hard enough or if youre smart enough. But it doesnt work thatway.Large social changes take place only when the market is ready  meaning whenmillions of individuals are ready for such change. No matter who was leading themovement, great social changes have occurred only when the market was ready forthem. If it was, the social changers succeeded if they acted wisely. If the market wasntready, they couldnt move it.Differences againWeve seen that we live in a world of different people  with different values,tastes, knowledge, moralities, ideas, and beliefs.The range of diversity among moralities, religions, and philosophies is as great asit is among tastes in clothing and TV entertainment. Everyone is different from hisneighbors in some way. There are no unified blocks of people who share a philosophywithout deviation. Witness the arguments among Catholics and among Socialists.Every individual seeks his own happiness. You or I might think a personmisguided in the way he seeks it, but he seeks it avidly nonetheless. And even if herelies on someone else to tell him how to get it, he wont necessarily choose you orme as the one to tell him.What we view as a social injustice is merely someones method of seekinghappiness. If you think that someone or some group of people is unjustly poor, youropinion implies that someone else should be giving them more money 82Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldthrough jobs or charity. That someone else is the person whose happiness seekingmethods disturb you.In the same way, if you feel that certain people are being repressed politically, itimplies that someone has the power to keep them from doing what they want to do.Again, you disapprove of the way in which that someone is seeking his happiness.The desire to change social conditions is the desire to change or prevent thehappiness-seeking methods of the individuals you dont approve of.Its easy to feel that an overhaul of some kind can set things right: laws passed toguarantee income to the poor, political leaders removed, regulations enforced toprevent racial prejudice, tax rates reduced or abolished, etc. Once the overhaul is done, theproblems will cease. But will they?Probably not. Its a mistake to assume that the villains will no longer causetrouble. Thats highly unlikely. They will continue to seek their happiness (as all humanbeings do), and each of them will do it in the way he knows best.The way he knows best isnt going to be overhauled by the changes you engineer.Hell still believe he was doing the right thing (for him).The New OrderNo matter what social changes are made, human beings will continue to bedifferent from one another. Any new order of things will be opposed by manydissidents  just as you might oppose the old order now. The opponents of the newway will work to change it, and theyll be joined by others (previously unaffected andunnoticed) who are bothered by the new conditions.Youll have to work just as hard to defend your changes as you did to bring themabout. There wont be a stopping point where you can say the job is done and you canreturn to your private life to enjoy the blessings of freedom.Theres no way you could alter society so that every individual in it will have theopportunity to live his life as he wants to. There are too many conflicts of interest.Someone will have to be dissatisfied; in fact, a great many people will have to bedissatisfied  just as you may be now.You can believe that once the changes are made, the general benefits will be obviousand people will be glad the changes were made; but dont count on it. Thats fallinginto the Identity Trap  expecting someone else to react to things as you would.You can take the attitude that your way is the right way and that those whodisagree are simply wrong. But that doesnt make any difference. Those wrong peoplewill still be upset and create problems for you.The Utopia Trap83There will always be disputes, conflicts, and problems to deal with. No system canbe established that would be completely peaceful, irrevocable, or permanent.Lets look at a couple of examples to illustrate this.Suppose that you wish to see property rights respected. That standard appears tobe simple, straightforward, unambiguous, and reasonable. It wouldnt seem difficult toestablish that as a basic principle of a society.But there are plenty of people who believe that freedom includes taking what theyneed from others  usually through political action. Many of them considerinequalities in wealth to be conditions of slavery. They would continue to fight for thesocial conditions they want.Even if somehow everyone agreed with the basic principle of property rights,and it were implemented by law or custom, there would still be many disputes. Whatis property? How can boundaries be defined? Who trespassed first? What constitutesinterference? Who makes the final, binding decision to resolve a dispute? You mayhave answers to those questions, but that doesnt mean others will accept youranswers.Or suppose your objective is a society in which everyone has at least a minimumstandard of living. What happens if someone cant obtain that minimum throughnormal market exchanges? Who will be required to give up some of his wealth tobring the first person up to par? Will those who have to provide it be free? Will theyrefrain from trying to evade your laws? Will they continue to produce wealth theycant keep?No matter what standard governs a society, there will be disputes and unfree people.And those people will fight for what they believe to be right for them. Youll be livingin basically the same kind of society in which you live today  complete with pressuregroups, arguments, subjective interpretations of the rules, and opponents who are tryingto change the system to their advantage.Any governing principle presupposes a method for resolving disputes within theterms of that principle. That requires an agency (such as a court) that can enforce itsdecision  by violence, if necessary  to be effective.That means that someone somewhere will make a decision to be imposed uponsomeone else who wont like it. The judges decision will be based upon his ownpersonal perception, interpretation, and sense of justice.Even if you bring about the general social change you want, the implementation ofyour change by leaders, judges, or others may be vastly different from what youexpected.Those who rule will always do so by their own subjective standards  whethertheir authority is hereditary succession, a military takeover, or a vote of the people.There will be those within a society who approve, those who84Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worlddisapprove, and those who go their own ways and pay little attention to the rulers.In many ways, a social structure that appears at a distance to be governedobjectively by certain clear and fair principles will, in reality, be composed of humanbeings wholl apply those principles subjectively. And that, of course, is what wehave already. In fact, that kind of system has always existed  no matter what nameit may bear.The Price of LivingFree societies are usually dreams in which the dreamer hopes to be able to escapethe simple prices required to live happily in the real world. He may feel that hell nolonger have to fear economic changes that hurt his way of life, or that hell no longerhave to worry about protecting his property, or that he wont have to deal with thesocial conflicts he sees today.The irony is that you pay a lesser price when you accept the existence of thesocial disorders and deal with them individually. You pay a higher price when youwork to create a better society (through education, politics, etc.).Even so, you can be encouraged to attack a social disorder by thinking that itssomething abnormal, out of the ordinary, a simple flaw that can be easily correctedto restore things to normal.As I look at history, however, I become more and more convinced that what welive in is normal  that things have never been basically any different from what theyare now. Many things have changed, but the essence of social structures has remainedquite the same.In Florence during the Renaissance, in America during the 1970s, even in ahoped-for free society, the facts remain the same: No matter where or when you live,youll still have to deal with people different from you. Youll have to cope withpeople who dont want you to have what you want, and wholl try to take from youwhat you have. Changing the social structure wont change the prices youll have topay to get and keep what you want.That doesnt mean that one society cant be a happier place for you to live thananother. There are differences, and it makes sense to consider living in the societywhose rules most nearly coincide with the way you want to live. Thats a directalternative. It takes far less effort to find and move to the society that has what youwant than it does to try to reconstruct an existing society to match your standards.In the same way, if the society in which you live seems to be heading in adirection you dont like, it makes sense to get out before youre hurt by it. I like tothink, for instance, that I would have moved out of Nazi Germany before it was toolate.The Utopia Trap85There are some who would say I should have stayed and fought the tyrants, orthat I might not have seen the danger in time to get out. But no one could realisticallybelieve that my presence there would have made a difference in the national outcome.And if I hadnt seen the danger soon enough to avoid it, I certainly wouldnt have seen itsoon enough to stop it.You cant change the fate of a nation, but you can do a great deal to make sureyoure not affected adversely by it. What you have to do is simply part of the price youpay to get what you want in life. And its always a far less expensive price than youdhave to pay to undertake a social change of any kind.No matter how difficult the task of changing society, the Utopia Trap is stillcompelling. And it appeals mainly, I think, because few individuals see any otheralternatives.So one can be induced to write letters, try to educate others, help get the rightperson elected, throw the tyrants out, and engage in numerous other activities. Butthese are all indirect alternatives. Your success will depend upon a whole series of ifs:if other people see the light, if other people do what you suggest, if, if, if. No wondersuch movements are so frustrating.And as we saw in the Group-Trap chapter, your individual participation in thoseactivities probably wont affect the outcome one way or the other.Using your PowerIf the prospects for social change are pretty bleak, the prospects for individualfreedom arent.If youre not free now, it isnt because you havent done enough to change theworld. Quite the contrary, it may be that youve been doing too much to try to change theworld. The effort youve expended in that direction could have been used to providefreedom for yourself.There probably are dozens of direct alternatives available to you that wouldeliminate the effects of social injustice from your own life. And thats really theobject, isnt it?Are taxes too high? You waste precious attention when you try to change the taxstructure. There are always ways to avoid paying those high taxes; all you have to dois find them.Is the government getting too repressive? You could spend the rest of your lifefighting it, but your actions wont change the fate of the nation. However, you canmake sure the repression doesnt get in your way.The only clear path to freedom is through direct alternatives  decisions thatdont require that you influence others. Direct alternatives always exist, and theyrealmost always far more effective than indirect alternatives.86Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThere are hundreds  thousands!  of ways to be free when you concentrateupon the power you have. But you cant see them if youre occupied trying to changeothers.Further ahead, well devote eleven chapters to specific methods you can use tofree yourself of the chains that may be binding you. All of the methods employ directalternatives. None of them requires that you change others or change yourself.An Exciting WorldThe Identity Trap is the assumption that someone else will react as you would.The Utopia Trap is that assumption carried to its ultimate conclusion  theexpectation that you can make the rest of the world correspond to your dreams.You cant. And when you try to do so, you only succeed in throwing away thevery real opportunities for freedom that you already possess.The world is an exciting and beautiful place. It might not seem so if yourebogged down with restrictions on every side. But those who have recognized theirown powers and used them to be free see little need to change the world.The world-changers are powerless. They dream of remaking the world; but sincethey cant, theyve placed their emphasis where they have no power at all.Free people recognize that they cant change the world, and so they concentrateon the power they do have  which is enormous. They realize that they can choosenot to be involved in situations that dont suit them.So they look for those situations that do suit them. And they discover far moreopportunities for such situations than most people imagine exist.A free person doesnt try to remake the world or his friends or his family. He merelyappraises every situation by the simple standard: Is this what I want for myself? If itisnt, he looks elsewhere. If it is, he relaxes and enjoys it  without the problems mostother people take for granted.A free person uses his tremendous power of choice to make a comfortable lifefor himself.The power of choice. You have it. But you forfeit it when you imagine that youcan choose for others. You cant.But you can choose for yourself  from hundreds of exciting, happiness-producing alternatives.Why not use that power?The Utopia Trap87When I remember how many of my private schemes have miscarried;how speculations have failed, agents proved dishonest, marriage been adisappointment; how I did but pauperize the relative I sought to help;how my carefully governed son has turned out worse than mostchildren; how the thing I desperately strove against as a misfortune didme immense good; how while the objects I ardently pursued broughtme little happiness when gained, most of my pleasures have come fromunexpected sources; when I recall these and hosts of like facts, I amstruck with the incompetence of my intellect to prescribe for society. Herbert SpencerDont worry about the whole world: if you do it will overwhelm you.Worry about one wave at a time. Please yourself. Do something foryou, and the rest will fall in line.n David Seabury88Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World11The Burning-Issue TrapThe Burning-Issue Trap is the belief that there are compelling social issues thatrequire your participation.There are always numerous issues before the public  competing for yourattention, your concern, your time, and energy. When you view an issue by itself, it canseem very compelling; you can feel that it cant be ignored and that you must dosomething about it. If you become aware of something evil and dangerous, it can seemthat youre compelled to work socially to correct it and eliminate the evil.But if you stand back and look at the whole spectrum of social issues that clamor foryour attention, you get a different perspective. Lets identify some of the many issues thatwriters, politicians, and crusaders have told us are do-or-die, must-be-taken-care-of-right-now matters.During recent years theyve included such things as pollution, civil rights,overpopulation, drugs, conservation, communism, consumerism, womens liberation,poverty, organized crime, law and order, disappearance of animal species, the sexualrevolution, government solvency, pornography, educational problems, mental illness,privacy, high taxes, the Vietnam war, campus riots, the military-industrial complex,police brutality, and disarmament. Plus perhaps a dozen more Ive overlooked, plus afew more that have become issues since I wrote this.All these issues are presented as matters commanding your attention andparticipation. But how could you possibly become involved in all of them? And if youcould, what would become of your freedom? How can you be free when youreburdened with a responsibility to right the worlds wrongs?You can enslave yourself by assuming a responsibility to observe, judge, and correctany social problems. For the problems will continue indefinitely. Theyll never beresolved to everyones satisfaction. The demands upon your time, energy, and moneycan never cease.Look back over the past 25 years. Can you think of a single social issue of themagnitude and popularity of those just listed that has been successfully resolved? Hasany desperate social need been satisfied? And has the world stopped because of thefailures?89At the outset of most campaigns, the organizers assume that a given effort willsolve the problem once and for all; just educate enough people, get enough petitionssigned, pass a certain law, and the issue will be resolved and we can go back to ourprivate lives.But once people are educated, they have to be re-educated; new ideas from othersources may turn those youve educated away from the direction in which youd thoughtyoud steered them. And once laws are passed, they can be amended or repealed, so thepassing of a law doesnt end anything.Campaigns for social change are excellent examples of the indirect alternative working through others to get what you want. Your success depends on theresponses of literally thousands of people. Your control over the situation is minute.And if the issue is important, youre enlisting for life. If you do achieve any short-term goal, youll have to safeguard your victory for the rest of your life.The existence of evil isnt a claim upon you. Evil will always exist inthe world. To accept as a principle that you must fight somethingbecause its evil is to believe you must fight anything thats evil. Theresno end to the number of evils that could command your attention. Is thatall your life is for  to spend it fighting evil?Somehow the world goes on  evils, issues, and all. During this century peoplehave coped with world wars, depressions, prejudice, organized crime, and most of theother issues mentioned before. None of them has been resolved; they occur andreoccur.But through them all, free people in any country have found ways of living theirlives freely and happily without feeling a responsibility to be involved. Their lack ofparticipation hasnt changed the outcome of any social issue, but it has enabled themto be free.QuestionsWhen youre asked to participate in a crusade to deal with any social issue, thematter can seem very compelling. But you can get a better perspective on the issue ifyou ask yourself a few questions:1. How much do you really know about the issue in which youre about to getinvolved? Do you recognize that youre hearing only one side of the problem? Is theperson providing the facts to you qualified to determine the extent of the problem?Once an issue gets started, a lot of people in the press, politics, and perhaps inyour neighborhood will jump on the bandwagon. Most of them simply repeat90Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldwhat theyve heard. The quantity of repetition can be pretty impressive, but thatdoesnt tell you how true or significant their statements are.I dont have unquestioning faith in scientists or specialists; I dont believe theynecessarily have all the answers  even though they may spend many years in a particularfield. But I have even less faith that the answers to social problems will be forthcomingfrom broadcasters, politicians, crusaders, picket lines, or TV personalities. Do their soundand fury constitute factual evidence upon which you should act?2. How do you know the solutions sought will end the problem? They might evencause greater problems.For example, theres a great demand that the government outlaw pesticides thatare supposedly hurting crops. The government is being asked to protect us. But itwas the U.S. Department of Agriculture that pressured farmers into using thepesticides in the first place. The governments original solution to a problem hasbrought about a new problem.3. Is the issue really of significance to you? If the standard to be applied is theexistence of injustice, evil or hardship, then there are millions of issues you must dealwith, regardless of whether they affect your life. But there are also plenty of mattersthat apply directly to you. Isnt that where your time can be best spent?4. Is it possible that youre responding to social pressure rather than genuineconcern over the issue? Perhaps youre becoming involved in order not to appearunconcerned, selfish, or ignorant.If you get involved for those reasons, youre walking into the Unselfishness Trapor the Morality Trap. What others choose to do with their lives is up to them, but youhave no obligation to cooperate.Solving ProblemsIf an issue concerns you, there are both direct and indirect alternatives available toyou. The indirect alternative is to try to change the prevailing social trend  whichinvolves changing others. The direct alternatives are the ways by which you can handlethe problem so that it doesnt affect you personally.The second way is by far the easier. Lets look at some examples:Are you being discriminated against because youre a woman? How long would ittake to reorient society so that most businesses would offer better job opportunities towomen? Probably a very, very long time.On the other hand, what do you really need? You obviously dont need to havefifty million new jobs available for females; you couldnt fill them all.The Burning-Issue Trap91Perhaps you resent men treating women as sex objects. Does it really matter ifmillions of men continue to do so? What do you really need?Chances are you only need one job and one man (or maybe two or three). Do youneed to overhaul all of society just to get one good job? Do you need to reeducateall men just to be able to enjoy one good one?Why not, instead, use some selectivity in trying to meet men who treat women theway you want to be treated? Im sure such men exist  no matter what your tastes.And why not pass by the job where you know women will be treated as inferiors?Look for employers or customers who are concerned with value first and foremost.Theyre likely to be those who are the most intensely profit-seeking. Those peoplewant quality for their money, not gender.You need only one man, one job, one place to live, one set of friends. To findthem, is it really necessary to become involved in a social movement to change thethinking of millions of people?Other IssuesAre you afraid that the drug culture will destroy society? Why? Alcohol hasnt even though its created reckless drivers, alcoholics who steal to support their habits,and all the other problems attributed to drugs.If you think drugs are dangerous, dont use them. If youre afraid for yourchildren, then concentrate your attention on them, not on a problem youll neversolve. I cant guarantee that youll insulate your children from drugs; but if you cant,how could you hope to insulate society at large from drugs?Are you appalled by protest and violence on college campuses? Then dont sendyour child to a college where such things happen. Dont expect to change the attitudesof students; their motives are their own.Are you afraid that consumers are cheated by manufacturers? Then dont buyfrom sellers who cant prove the worth of their products. If goods are generally oflow quality, its because sellers have found that buyers prefer not to pay more forbetter goods.But that doesnt have to affect you. You can always find, within the GeneralMarket, sellers who cater to your minority tastes.You could crusade for government-enforced quality standards. But historydemonstrates that government interference produces worse products, not better.Government standards create red tape, contradictory laws, dictatorial agencies,payoffs, and the loss of your opportunity to buy the products you want but that dontplease bureaucrats.92Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf youre afraid there wont be enough food to go around someday, stock up inadvance. Wouldnt that be easier than trying to get the whole world to limitpopulation? (With farmers paid not to grow crops, it isnt surprising that food outputisnt increasing faster.)The demands that you limit your family to one child are based upon an average ofwhat some people think is the total amount of food and space available. But how isthat relevant to you? Acting on such considerations is an example of the Group Trap treating things collectively instead of individually.By the same reasoning, you shouldnt drive a car or eat steak or have more than aone-room house for your family  based upon an average of how much is available forthe whole world.The appropriate question is, How much food and space do you have? Do you haveenough to support the family you want, taking into consideration possible changes ofcircumstances? What will be the consequence to you?If youre concerned about the depletion of natural resources, move to an area wherethey still exist and buy property that you can preserve the way you want it. If youdont want to live there, are you sure the issue is important to you? And if you dowant to live there, the cost of property would be less than the cost of trying to changethe thinking of the whole country regarding such things.The entire issue of conservation has always seemed to be a strange one for me.Ive never been able to figure out for whom were saving the irreplaceable resources.If we arent allowed to use them, then the next generation shouldnt use them either,nor the one after that.As certain resources are depleted, others are brought into use. Profit-seekinginnovators look for ways to solve such problems because the rewards they receive areworth it. When attempts are made to hold back that evolution, people can wind uppaying more for what they value less.For example, conservationists say that trees should be saved by using recycledpaper. A UPI news item reports that Bank of America, American Telephone, Coca-Cola, and McGraw-Hill are among the companies using recycled ecology bondpaper. The cost at the mill is $20 to $40 more per ton than new paper of comparablegrade.13That higher cost is an indication that the resources required to recycle paper aremore precious to the General Market than the cost of new paper. If people trulyvalued timber in its uncut form, the cost of it would be higher than the cost ofrecycling paper. The price of anything is an indication of its attractiveness and scarcity,compared to other things. When attempts are made to overrule the natural expressionsof the General Market, higher prices are inevitable.The Burning-Issue Trap9313Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, August 12, 1971.SlogansMy few brief remarks concerning these social issues are by no means finalanswers to any of the questions. But, then, neither are the popular slogans uttered onbehalf of ecology, liberation, consumerism, and conservation.Theres always a great deal more involved than is popularly discussed. Andtheres always something you can do for yourself that doesnt require changing otherpeople.Ask yourself what youd do if you were sure you couldnt change the attitudes ofothers. What then would you do by yourself to keep the problem from affecting you?If you approach it on that basis, you usually find that there are many more directalternatives available than youd noticed while you were busy trying to change others.Even if you could make big changes in the world, the cost would be gigantic. Itsalways simpler and less costly to look for direct alternatives  as opposed to thosethat depend upon getting other people to act as you want them to act. That principleapplies in any area of life.Change will take place as a result of broad changes of interests in the GeneralMarket. Some changes youll like; some you wont. But those changes will occurwhether or not you participate in these matters.So you have a choice: should you involve yourself in efforts to advance or retardthe change  where your efforts will make little difference  or should you simplymake any personal adjustments necessary as the changes take place?Participation in burning-issue movements might be a good way to meet like-minded people, or it might be that you enjoy the challenges involved. But if you jumpinto them because you think your participation will change the course of the world,youre probably making a grave mistake.My PrejudicesThese remarks werent intended to sell my side of any of these social issues.As a matter of fact, I more often fit naturally on the same side as the crusaders. Idont care for low-quality products that might hurt me; I dont use drugs; I dontbelieve I harbor any racial prejudices; I love women for their minds and theiremotions, as well as their sexiness. And I dont intend to have children (but notbecause I think the earth is overpopulated).But these are matters I can handle on my own. I moved to Vancouver, Canada,from Los Angeles because I was tired of the smog, noise, and traffic. I enjoy seeingbeautiful trees around my home; the owners of those trees wont cut them down, becausethey prefer the beauty to the timber value.94Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldId feel foolish, however, trying to tell other people that they should reorient theirlives to eliminate smog, noise, and traffic. Many people do prefer to live in Los Angelesas it is; thats why theyre there.I take the various demands that I join causes with a grain of salt. I realize that thepeople who lead these movements have their own personal objectives. Many of themwould be lost without their causes; thats how they find their happiness. Where would theconsumer advocates be without General Motors? Or the employees of the cancerorganizations without smokers? Or the politicians without those pressing, critical,burning issues?All that is their business, but not necessarily yours or mine.Burning issues are always presented in terms that make it appear that yourfreedom is at stake. Well, it is. If youre lured into devoting your precious life to theresolution of social problems, that can end your freedom. Youll carry the burden ofresponsibility for all the problems of the world.Is it possible that youre assuming that once the various social issues are resolved,youll be able to relax and enjoy your own life? If so, the lessons of history indicatethat those issues will always be with us in one form or another.Youre not going to live forever. With the years ahead of you, why notstart now to concentrate on making your life as meaningful, free, exciting,and joyous as possible?You are the most important issue in the world. What happens in the social issuesis only incidental; to concentrate on them is to approach the matter much tooindirectly. What you do directly for yourself will have a far greater impact on your lifethan what you do in response to the burning issues of society.Make your life the issue.Diary: How to Improve the World (You will only make mattersworse). John CageIn brief, sir, study what you most affect. William ShakespeareThe Burning-Issue Trap9512The Previous-Investment TrapThe Previous-Investment Trap is the belief that time, effort, and money spent in thepast must be considered when making a decision in the present.For example, a woman decides not to divorce an incompatible husband becauseshes already invested twelve years in the marriage. Or a man refuses to quit anunpleasant job because hes had it for fifteen years. Or an investor hangs on to alosing stock because he believes he shouldnt sell it until it rises to the price he paid forit. Or a person continues to fight for a losing cause because hes already invested tenyears in the movement.In each case, the individual feels that to change the situation would mean wastingthe previous investment. Its as if he were saying, If I change now, those years werewasted; but if I stay where I am, those years (somehow) were good. But whatdifference does it make? The years are gone, irretrievable.What matters now is what happens in the future. And that will depend upon whatyou do now with whatever you have available to you.The expenditure of resources is important only before you spend them. Oncespent, theyre insignificant. What is significant is what youve received in exchangefor them.If youve put twelve years into a losing marriage, whats the best you can get fromthis point forward? If it would take another twelve years to establish as good amarriage with someone else, you may decide not to make that new investment. But ifit would take only twelve days to develop the same rapport with someone else, youdbe throwing away an opportunity by letting the past twelve years influence you.When a financial investment (such as a stock) drops in price, the price youoriginally paid for it becomes irrelevant because you dont have that money anymore.All you have is the present value of the investment.In what way can you use that to make the most in the future? If you think thestock youre holding is going straight up from here, youll want to hold onto it (butnot because of what you paid for it). If you think there are other stocks that will risefaster, then you should sell the present stock and buy something with a better future.96In every case, the question is: With what you have now, what is the best way to usethat to get the most in the future? What youve paid to get to where you are now isirrelevant; those resources are gone and cant be retrieved, no matter what you do.The Previous-Investment Trap can sometimes be very subtle. I knew a womanwho paid $150 for a 15-lesson course. After sitting through the first three lessons, boredstiff, she decided it was a mistake. I suggested she spend her Wednesday evenings in amore profitable way (such as with me).I cant do that, she said. I have a $150 tied up in it; I have to see it through.She was saying, in effect, Since Ive already wasted my money on this, Im nowgoing to waste my time, too.Money spent in the past is gone. You can never get it back. You may get theequivalent of it again. But to do so, you must choose the most profitable alternativeavailable to you now. Where you spent the money in the past has nothing to do withthe question.The TrapYoure in the Previous-Investment Trap whenever you allow what youveexpended in the past to be a determining factor when deciding what to do in thefuture. Learn from the past, but never feel you have to justify a past investment byhanging on to it.The mark of a good financial investor is his ability to recognize when has made amistake, sell out, and prevent his losses from getting worse. Most investors becomeemotionally attached to the decisions theyve made, so they hang on in hopes ofrecouping the investment later  and they usually wind up losing more.The same thing applies to any area of your life. Recognize your losses. Dont assumeyou can lead a mistake-free life. You cant. But you can recognize your mistakes earlyand thereby prevent them from compounding into gigantic losses.If a relationship is wrong, end it and look for a better one. If youve spent yourmoney unwisely, accept it, and determine the best action for the future withThe Previous-Investment Trap97what you have left. If youve devoted yourself to a cause that now appears fruitless,get out of it and move on to something that will bring you happiness.Dont try to justify past mistakes by perpetuating them. For when you do, you throwaway the future you could have had.There is a bright, glorious, free future ahead  if you keep looking forward.A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong,which is but saying, in other words, that he is wisertoday than he was yesterday.98Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World Alexander Pope13The Box TrapMany people complain that freedom isnt possible in the real world. Often theperson complaining is an individual who has accepted restrictions upon his life thatmake it seem impossible to be free. In effect, hes in a box.A box is any uncomfortable situation that restricts an individuals freedom.And the Box Trap is the assumption that the cost of getting out of a bad situationis too great to consider.Its easy to slip into a box and just as easy to stay there. You can come to believethat a difficult situation is just part of living and must be accepted. Lets look at someexamples of boxes.A young doctor might decide, after ten years in medicine, that he really doesntlike it. But he stays where he is, assuming theres no way out. If you ask him why hedoesnt change, he may not have a clear, precise reason.It may be that hes unwilling to acknowledge that hes chosen the wrongprofession, or that he doesnt want to disappoint his proud mother. Or maybe hes inthe Previous-Investment Trap  thinking that he cant throw away the more thanten years of his life hes put into medicine.A box can be a minor irritant  like a boring monthly family dinner at yourrelatives home. Or a pain in the shoulder that continues daily but which you donothing about.Or a box can be a big thing  such as the situation of a woman who realizes thather marriage is nothing like her conception of what a marriage should be. She remainsin the box because she feels it is unthinkable to try to get out of it.The Box Trap is the vague feeling that the box must be accepted because theresno way out.PriceEverything you want in life has a price connected to it. Theres a price to pay if youwant to make things better, a price to pay just for leaving things as they are, a pricefor everything.The price may be in time, effort, money, emotional turmoil, or physicaldiscomfort. It always comes back to time, however. You arent going to live99forever, so time is a limited resource. Whatever you do with your time, you pay a price byforgoing other alternatives  other things you could have done with that time. Thatswhy you choose; you hope to satisfy your highest values and let the others go.A key to good decision-making is the ability to recognize what youre giving up whenyou choose something. Its obvious that you cant have everything you desire. Butoften, when choosing to do something, you can overlook the desirable things thatyoull have to forego because of the choice youre making.So its important to recognize what youre giving up and to make sure that whatyoure getting is more valuable to you than what youre foregoing. If you do that,youre less likely to have mixed emotions later when the other things appear desirableto you.BoxesIn effect, a box is any situation that restrains your freedom. As long as you stay init, you suffer a discomfort of some kind and you forego other alternatives that aremore desirable to you.The box could be a bad marriage, an unpleasant occupation, a debt for somethingof no value to you, or a social obligation of some kind. A box can also be the problemsinvolved in maintaining an image or reputation that isnt genuinely yours  such ashaving to watch what you say.Youre in the Box Trap if you tolerate any such situation by assuming theres noway out of it.The first thing to recognize is that youre paying a price every day you remain inthe box. Youre foregoing more attractive alternatives. And you suffer discomfortjust from knowing that you dont like the situation, plus the discomfort of whateveryou have to do to keep from rocking the boat.The second thing to recognize is that there is a way out. To get out, you have topay a price. The price may be in emotional upheaval, in money, in time spent to makethings right. Whatever it is, there is a price you can pay to get out.Part of the problem is usually the vagueness of the situation. Its easy to assumethat the cost of getting out is too horrible to contemplate, and so you dont eventhink about it directly. As a result, you can go on living daily in a box without everknowing exactly what it would require to get out.If you could know specifically what youre paying by staying where you are andwhat you would have to pay to get out, you could make a definite choice. Youdknow which alternative was truly best for you.100Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldGetting out of BoxesIf theres a box in your life (big or little), let me suggest a simple method ofputting it in focus.Take a few minutes away from everything else. Find a comfortable chair in a quietroom where you can consider the problem without interruption.First, identify the box. What is it thats causing you the discomfort?For example, suppose youve lied to someone and now find it difficult to maintainthe lie. Youre no longer able to express yourself freely for fear of saying somethingthat would contradict the lie.Or perhaps your weekends are continually interrupted by relatives who drop inand monopolize your only free time. Or maybe youve made a commitment tocontribute money to a particular cause but now you wish you were free to spend themoney elsewhere.Whatever it is, identify the discomfort the box causes.Next, think of what you would do if you werent in the box. At first, the onlyadvantage you can think of might be the absence of the discomfort. But in some waythe box is preventing you from doing something youd prefer to do. And if it wereremoved, youd be free to take advantage of desirable alternatives.Imagine the box gone. And then imagine what youd do once you were free of it.As you do, its possible that the thought of one free activity might lead to another.And before long you may be able to think of many desirable possibilities that hadntoccurred to you before.The next step is to identify the price it would take to get out of the box. As I saidearlier, it may not have even occurred to you that there is a price that would get youout.But theres always a way out. If you were to walk out of the box right now, whatwould it cost you? What would happen that youve been dreading?The price could be fearful or it could be trivial. But there is a price that could getyou out of the situation.If youve lied to someone, you may have to admit that you lied to get out of thebox. If so, the price might be the shame of admitting the lie, or the loss of the personsfriendship, or the time involved to re-establish a reputation for honesty  or possiblyall those things.The price might be a confrontation with someone  such as telling your spouseyou dont want to remain married, telling your boss you want a better arrangement ifyoure going to continue to work for him, or breaking off a relationship with a friendor relative who brings you only grief.Identify what youd have to do in order to end your present discomfort.The Box Trap101Then picture yourself paying that price. It may be painful just to think about it.But try.If a confrontation is involved, imagine yourself going through the necessaryconversation. Construct an imaginary dialogue with the other people involved. Dontskip over it; mentally live through every word spoken by each person.As you do, try to think of unexpected things that might come up. Try to foresee theside of a persons character that hasnt been shown to you before. What if he gets mad?What if he starts to cry? What if he becomes abusive?Go through the entire experience in your mind. If its the least bit painful, go throughit a second time. When you do, it should be less painful. Keep doing this  as manytimes as are necessary until you can go through the whole thing mentally without itbothering you.With this, you will have identified clearly the three elements of your situation: (1)what youre paying by remaining where you are; (2) what it would cost you to get out;and (3) what you could do once youre out.As long as the situation is just a hazy problem with no solution, it can always seemeasier to let things continue unchanged  as uncomfortable as it may be. But whenyou recognize what its costing you to stay in the box and what you could do if youwere out of it, you gain new incentive to do something about it.The price of getting out might have seemed horrendous when viewed vaguelyfrom a distance. But now that youve identified it clearly, it may lose its power tofrighten you. That wont necessarily happen in every case, but it is likely enough to beworth checking.In most cases, a half hour spent in this way will lead to the conclusion that itseasier to pay the price and get out than to stay locked in the box.Making TestsI dont suggest that you grab this technique and run out to break up a marriage ortell your mother goodbye.Its a common example of the Intellectual Trap to think that your emotions willautomatically adjust to a good idea. And many people have learned by sad experiencethat they arent emotionally ready to carry off the ideas theyve intellectuallyaccepted.Its far better to test such ideas in smaller matters and cautiously lead up to thebigger ones.Take a minor irritant in your life as a first test. Decide what its costing you, whatit will cost to be rid of it, and what youll do with the freedom youll acquire whenyoure rid of it. Then pay the price.102Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf you have a friend or relative who has been a constant drain on your time, trytelling him that youre going to be involved with other things and will no longer havethe time to spend with him.You might not look forward to the confrontation, but if you experience itmentally first, it will be easier to approach. Be prepared for surprises  reactions youdidnt anticipate  so they dont throw you off balance when they happen.If the conversation becomes difficult and youre tempted to give in, remindyourself of the rewards awaiting you when you get through this. Keep rememberingall the good things youll be able to do with the time youre rescuing.The confrontation may be difficult, but the next morning you might wake up to abrighter day. You may be surprised at the sense of weightlessness you feel for havingremoved a burden from your shoulders  a burden you had assumed you were stuckwith forever.No matter what the discomfort, theres always a price you can pay to get rid of it.Suppose youve acquired a debt for something you bought that you really dontcare for anymore. Each month you have to write out a check for money youd muchrather use elsewhere. It can be a monthly torment  a symbol that youve made acostly mistake.Why put up with it? Theres always a way out.Maybe you have twenty payments left. If so, dont take the attitude that you haveto endure this discomfort for twenty more months. Theres a price available that will endit now.See what you can sell the item for. Dont fall into the Previous Investment Trapby thinking you cant take a loss on it. You only increase your losses  in money andemotional distress  by hanging onto it.The outstanding debt may be more than the amount you could sell it for. If so,why not pay the difference in cash and get rid of the problem? Or sell something elseyou dont need to make up the difference.You dont gain anything by waiting the twenty months. By then the item will beworth even less, so youll simply lose more money by hanging onto it. Sell it now, paythe difference, and end the problem. Then you wont have to write those monthlychecks anymore.However you handle an irritant, theres no reason to assume you have to endure itjust because youve made a mistake. Theres always a price you can pay to clear therecord and start fresh.The Box Trap103Pay the PriceCultivate the art of looking for prices anytime you notice a discomfort. Find outwhat it would take to be rid of it; theres always a way. If the first price you discoverseems too big to be worth it, think about it some more; perhaps theres an easier way.Once you get into the habit of looking for prices, youll realize that any irritant inyour life can be handled. Youll no longer tolerate that slow, chronic discomfort thateats away at you daily  destroying your incentive, making you think less of yourself,darkening your attitude toward the world.As you develop this talent, you can move up gradually to the bigger boxes in yourlife, dealing with them in the same way. Later, well spend three chapters discussingthe techniques of handling major changes.And one day you might wake up to realize that there isnt anything hanging overyour head. Youre free!  free to approach the day as you want to live it, notrestricted by the chronic problems that other people take for granted.Ive never found an exception to the rule that the sooner you pay a price, the lessit costs you. As long as a situation continues, you pay a price just knowing that thesituation is unresolved. And the longer a situation continues, the firmer other peoplebecome in their attitude that you have no right to initiate a change.No matter how long a situation continues, theres always a way to get out. Butthe sooner you handle it, the easier it is.Whenever I can I choose to pay in advance. But if I become aware of a mistake, Iwant to pay the price as fast as possible and clear the record. Ive become fanaticallyintolerant of permanent irritants.Even so, I occasionally carry a burden around with me a while before I recognizeit. Its usually a small discomfort that just seems to hang over me, never quite painfulenough to make me fully aware of it but always taking the edge off something I couldbe enjoying.Then, suddenly, it dawns on me whats happening. The first thing I want todetermine is exactly what the discomfort is. Then I want to know what I might beafraid of thats allowed the discomfort to perpetuate. And I want to know what Idhave to do to be rid of it, once and for all.Then I want to get to it as fast as I can, pay it, and be free to go onto betterthings.If the price is higher than Id anticipated, the point is still the same. I still have topay it. Theres no point in complaining, blaming someone else, or trying to stand upfor my rights. The sooner I pay the price, the sooner Im free of whatever thetrouble has been.104Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAs always, its important to concentrate on the direct alternatives. You may feelthat someone else is partly or wholly to blame for your problems. But so what? Youonly waste precious time and attention when you try to make him pay the price. Youchose wrongly, or you wouldnt be in the situation; thats why you have a price to pay.What happens to him from now on is his problem. Hell have to continue livingwith whatever it is that bothers you about him. But all you have to do is pay the price,and he wont be a problem to you anymore.FreedomSo many people live in chains of their own making. They cry out for freedomfrom political policies they dont like; they complain about the villains who preventthem from being free. And all the time they voluntarily tolerate boxes that reduce theirfreedom of action by 20 to 50% or more.Getting out of boxes may not get the politicians off their backs. But if freedom isso important to them, why dont they remove the chains that are within reach?Take a look at your own life. What could you do today that would give you morefreedom tomorrow morning?If the dollars you lose in taxes are important to you, then what about the dollarsyou may be spending to perpetuate boxes you could get out of?If the hours required to earn the money to pay taxes are vital to you, then whatabout the hours you spend in uncomfortable relationships?Every dollar or hour you stop spending to preserve a box is one you could be usingfor better things. Every day outside a box is another day added to your free life.In addition, when you get out of those boxes, youll be much freer to takeadvantage of opportunities that will free you in other areas  such as removing thepolitical chains from your back.As I mentioned in Chapter 10, youre often prevented from using an attractivealternative in one area because youre restricted in another. When youre no longerdeep in debt or stifled for time by bad relationships, you can take advantage of themany alternatives available to get rid of high taxes and political repression.The Box Trap is the assumption that theres no way out of a box. Theres alwaysa way, always a price you can pay to be rid of it once and for all. Find it and pay it.The Box Trap105The nice part of it all is that you can get out of boxes just by exercising your owninitiative. Its a direct alternative that doesnt involve influencing others. All you have todo is pay the price.Instead of worrying endlessly about a vague, ominous threat, face it mentally. Get offby yourself, relax, recognize what youre paying already, discover what you could pay tobe rid of it, picture yourself paying it. And when it no longer frightens you, pay it and befree.There are always prices. You pay them whether you change things or leave themalone. The price that gets you out of a bad situation is by far the least expensive one. Itsusually far less terrifying than it was when you let it scare you from a distance.Pay it. You have nothing to lose but your boxes.When people wont let you alone, its because you havent learnedhow to make them do it. David Seabury106Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World14The Certainty TrapThe Certainty Trap is the urge to act as if your information were totally certain.Youre in the trap if you make decisions without recognizing the uncertainty of yourassumptions and the risk that goes with that.Its a normal urge to want to believe that one has the final answers to things. Certaintyis a more comfortable feeling than uncertainty.Unfortunately, a feeling of absolute certainty is usually unrealistic. At any giventime, you have at your disposal only a small fraction of the information you would need tomake a decision with complete foresight.When you buy a house, you have no way of being sure the government wontcondemn it next year to make way for a new road. When you plan a marketingcampaign, you have no assurance that your market surveys accurately reflect all theconditions that will affect your success. You can never know for sure the thoughts orplans or motivations of other people.Uncertainty isnt a curse, however. You can still act; you can still make decisions.You use the best information and reasoning you can muster. The important thing is torecognize the limits of the information youre using. There are variables you cantpossibly predict, theres knowledge thats less than certain, and theres the ever-present possibility that you havent drawn the best conclusions from what youveseen.None of these things need stop you from acting. But they must be recognized.They constitute the risk involved in what you do. And for every risk theres anaccompanying liability  a price youll have to pay if things dont go as you wantthem to.Youre in the Certainty Trap when you ignore that risk. In everything you do,theres always a risk. Sometimes the risk is negligible; often the liability that goeswith it is minor. But it exists and must be accepted in order to know what youredoing. Otherwise, you might walk overconfidently into a situation where your losscould be overwhelming.Loss of FreedomThe individual who ignores these risks can lose his freedom in three importantways:1071. Hes likely to take risks that would be unacceptable if he were torecognize them; and by acting rashly he can get himself into boxesthat restrict his freedom.2. When things dont go his way, his previous certainty can turn quicklyto despair and depression; after all, he was so sure. Now that hesdiscouraged, his emotions can tempt him to run from his badconsequences into a worse situation. In other words, hes fallen intothe Emotional Trap.3. By accepting opinions as absolute fact, he can allow his freedom to be restricted byinformation that may not be true.Lets explore this trap in more detail.UncertaintyThe desire for certainty can cause you to try to have an explanation for everythingthat happens.Many things that happen seem to defy explanation  at least at the time theyhappen. If so, accept that. If you think you have to have an explanation, you candevote a great deal of time and attention to finding the answer to something that maynot be that important. Or, worse yet, you could be tempted to accept a rashexplanation that isnt true  and which could cause you to act foolishly in a latersituation.For example, a man says, I was fired from my job because the boss doesnt likeJews; so Ill never work for a Gentile again. Or a woman says, I was out dancingwhen my mother had a heart attack; so as long as she lives, Ill never go dancing again.Or The Communists wanted that legislation and it passed; so there must be aconspiracy that I must devote my life to stopping. Or That no-talent actress becamea star  she must have slept with the producers; so I have to choose between beingpromiscuous or not acting.The same thing can apply to more mystical matters. For example, I dreamt ofthat accident before it happened; therefore I can predict the future. Or in reverse, Icant explain the feelings I have, so it must be proof that Ive lived a former life. OrI cant explain how the universe was created; so there must be a God.Theres nothing shameful in acknowledging that you dont have the answers toevery question about life. Just accept the fact that you know only a fraction of whatsgoing on in the world. You dont have to attach explanations in terms of a specialrevelation of Gods will, a glimpse at the supernatural, evidence of a conspiracy, oranything else.108Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldI was pleased to read a newspaper interview that demonstrated a calm, reasonableapproach to a very controversial subject. Perhaps you remember the best-selling bookThe Search for Bridey Murphy. In it, a hypnotist told how his patient recalled aprevious life as Bridey Murphy in Ireland from 1798 to 1864.For many people, the story was absolute proof of reincarnation. Others scoffedthat it was fraudulent or inaccurate.Virginia Tighe (called Ruth Simmons in the book) was the patient who had thestrange experience. Youd suppose that she would be the most certain of what itmeant. However, she treats the experience as something very unusual but not necessarilyproof of anything. In the newspaper interview in 1971 she said:I accepted the hypnotic experience as only that. An experience. I knowthat something happened, something unusual that was completely honest.Ive kept my mind open on anything beyond that.I thought all kinds of things might explain what had happened: perhaps agenetic memory or something I had read or something someone had toldme. But Ive never found a satisfactory explanation.Certainly, I still have doubts. I have come to accept the fact that it is possiblethat reincarnation was not impossible. But I would never sit here and tellanyone that I am the reincarnation of BrideyMurphy.14I see this as a very reasonable reaction to an amazing experience  unusuallyreasonable coming from the person who experienced it.You dont need an explanation for everything. Recognize that there are such things asmiracles  events for which there are no ready explanations. Later knowledge mayexplain those events quite easily. But at this date in history, you cant expect to knoweverything that might be known eventually.The Quality of InformationIts easy to forget that what we accept as certain knowledge from others is subjectto the human limitations of perception and logic. No one can be expected to knoweverything, to see everything with unfailing accuracy, and to interpret what he seeswith perfect judgment. And yet, its easy to accept verbatim the information thatshanded us.To do so, however, is to fall into the Certainty Trap.The Certainty Trap10914Los Angeles Times, May 5, 1971.Scientific books usually represent the best judgment of their writers, but whatthey see can easily be superseded later. Holy books claim to reveal Gods word, butthey, too, were written by fallible human beings expressing what they believed to betrue. How to do it books tell what the authors believe are the techniques thatworked for them; but they may be misinterpreting the causes of their success  andtheir techniques may not produce the same effects when you use them.Any book might contain useful ideas, suggestions, alternatives. They can besources of inspiration to help stimulate your search for answers. But to accept any ofthem as absolute, final answers to the problems and mysteries of life is to walk intothe Certainty Trap.The ExpertsIn the same way, its easy to over respect the judgment of someone who appearsto have mastered a given field. These are the experts  the individuals whoapparently have access to information thats outside your sphere of experience. Theycan range from your successful brother-in-law who has a hot stock market tip to therespected Ph.D. who heads a vast research foundation.Because your resources are limited, you rely upon other people for many things.Thats the specialization of labor. You acquire products built by other people, andyou pay for them by producing things in your own field of competence.Information is one of the things you acquire from others. But just as you may haveonce bought a car that turned out to be a lemon, you can also acquire information thatgoes sour. Information-providers can make mistakes, too.There may be many people who know much more than you do about somethings. But its wise to exercise some caution when acting upon the information youget from them.For example, a person whos been through years of medical school probablyknows a great deal more than you about the workings of your body. But dont besurprised if another doctor disagrees with his diagnosis. Years of schooling andexperience cant provide either of them with infallibility.After all, youre probably a specialist at something. Are you always right? Thereare plenty of day-to-day events that can get in the way of your being totally objective andimpartial. Why shouldnt you expect the same limitations to apply to other specialists?Experts are human beings; theyre fallible. An experts research and judgment canbe sidetracked by telephone calls, inter-office politics, emotional problems, politicalobjectives, hopes for promotion, and vested interests in110Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldpreviously stated opinions. Theres nothing shameful about that; its normal and to beexpected.Sometimes, truth and objectivity surmount all those obstacles. But you cantknow when and where they have  so its best to accept all judgments withreservations.Too often what everybody knows may have been originally the outburst of a manwho ran out of research time  or one who was bothered by a liver ailment  or itmay have been a satirical comment that was intended as a joke.There was a time, you know, when everyone knew the earth was flat and thesun revolved around it. Now, everyone knows better. But what we think we knowtoday may be superseded by even more realistic findings tomorrow.There is no source you can look to for the final truth and final answers toeverything, or even anything. You wont find them in the nations capital, thechurches, the courts, the universities, or among the insiders.What you hear from these sources are simply statements of opinion by humanbeings. If you accept them as such, youll be aware of the risks you take when you acton information, and youll be less likely to jump into trouble you cant handle.The TrapThe essence of the Certainty Trap is to disregard risks by overestimating thecertainty of the information upon which you base your decisions. Taking risks is aninherent part of life; its only dangerous when you act as though youre not taking arisk.Risks are forms of prices. You gamble with time when you choose to take a riskinstead of taking the time to be sure of what youre doing. If you win, youll have savedtime; if you lose, youll probably spend more time paying off the loss than you would havehad to spend checking things out in advance.Theres nothing wrong with taking a risk. The danger occurs when you dontrecognize that youre taking one.Youre in the Certainty Trap if you base your life on what someone has told youis the way to live  or on what someone has told you that God has commanded. Orany time you think that a course of action will produce absolutely certain results.Youre in the trap if you let your stockbrokers confidence induce you towithdraw all your savings and bet them on one stock. Or if you reorient your way of lifebecause of a new medical discovery published in the newspaper. Or when you allow aflash of inspiration to convince you that you have the final answer to something and let itcause you to take an unreasonable risk.The Certainty Trap111Its just as foolish to expect someone else to act on the basis of your knowledge.When youve decided you are sure enough of something to act upon it, it doesntmake sense to expect someone else to act with the same assurance. Thats a variationof the Identity Trap  expecting others to act as you would, using the sameknowledge and premises you use.Avoiding the TrapHere are some suggestions that may help you avoid the Certainty Trap:1. Popularity isnt proof. What everybody knows has been so obviously wrong somany times that I dont need to fill this book with evidence of it.If all your friends are about to embark upon a dangerous adventure and theyscoff at your caution, that isnt a reason for you to go against your own judgment.If everyone in your church or neighborhood is sure he knows exactly who andwhat God is, how to reach him, and what his rules for human behavior are, that isntevidence of anything  except evidence that a lot of people say they hold thatopinion.Or if everyone you know is buying real estate in a new development thats sureto skyrocket in price, thats not proof of anything. The crowd is wrong at least asoften as its right.Remember, everybody knew the nation was solvent in 1928.2. Be skeptical about new information. Be open to new possibilities, but acceptthem as possibilities, not as final truth. Be alert to new alternatives and newexplanations of things important to you, but dont lose sight of the fact that what youhear and discover may not be correct.3. Dont expect to have an explanation for everything. You may come across acause-and-effect relationship that seems to work for you. You do something and itseems to produce the result you want. Good. Use it, take advantage of it  but neverlose sight of the possibility that the system may not be exactly as you see it now. Inother words, dont bet your life on it.Dont let your guard down and plunge into situations where the risks are too great.Realize that in another situation, other factors may cause the system to work in adifferent way. By overlooking that, you might lose in one mistake all that youvegained by using the system in the past.If you find that prayer brings the results you want, good. But dont place yourselfin a situation where prayer is the only defense you have against trouble. It may notalways work for you in the same way.112Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf you discover a gambling system that seems to make money for you, use it. Butconsider banking your profits as you go  just in case the miracle suddenlyevaporates.4. Recognize that youre seeing only part of whats involved; you cant seeeverything. You just dont have the time and opportunity to check out everything. Soaccept the existence of other possibilities that may not be apparent at this moment. Acton what you see, but with due respect for the existence of other things you cant see.5. Recognize the risks and liabilities. And thats the most important point. Thereare always risks, and risks mean liabilities  prices to be paid if things dont go asyou want them to. When you recognize them, you can handle things in ways that makeyour losses less frequent and less critical.The individual who plows ahead unswervingly because he knows hes right isusually wrong. And when he runs head on into the brick wall he was so sure wouldntbe there, his losses are greater than those of the person who was more cautious.ReactionsWhen youre aware of risks, you can relax and accept the world. You lose thesense of pressure that commands you to have an answer for everything. Consequently,youre less likely to react emotionally if things go wrong.For example, whenever you cross a busy street youre taking a risk  even ifonly a slight one. Anything might happen. You could fail to see a car coming, even ifyou make it a point to look. You could be hit by an object dropped or thrown from anearby building. You could trip on a bump, turn your ankle, and be unable to get outof the path of oncoming cars.Such things dont happen often, but their rarity (combined with an overconfidentair) can cause people to react badly in various ways when they do happen. Oneperson will direct all his attention to blaming the villain who caused the accident.Another will be sure it was Gods will punishing him for his sins. Another willdecide hes been a fool for crossing streets, and now he knows he should never doit again (a vow hell probably keep until his leg heals and he needs to cross a streetagain).I think a reasonable person would most likely react by recognizing that he takesrisks all the time and that one of them has gone against him. Maybe the truck drivershouldnt have driven so fast, or the city should have fixed the bump. But hes alwaysknown that such things were possible and outside his control, so he automaticallyassumed a risk when he crossed the street.His only concern now is to pay the price, repair his damages as quickly aspossible, and get onto better things. He wont waste his time blaming people,The Certainty Trap113fearing Gods wrath, or making foolish resolutions. He knows that what happened ispart of being alive.The overconfident person approaches things as if he were acting with absolutecertainty. But because hes being unrealistic, he wastes his resources by taking foolishrisks. He throws away his freedom by rashly jumping into boxes. He often follows acode of conduct thats inappropriate to his nature because hes so sure hes receivedsome absolute word on the subject.When he runs into trouble, its such a contradiction to his attitude that it usuallycauses emotional problems. He often reacts to his disaster by leaping to conclusionsopposite to what he held before. Either he was all wrong before, but absolutelyright now  or he declares that the world is malevolent or incoherent.Meanwhile, the reasonable person recognizes the gamble in everything he does.Hes quite willing to take risks, but only when hes prepared to pay the liability if therisk goes against him. Mistakes, disappointments, losses dont sidetrack him; he keepsmoving toward the things he wants.He refuses to act rashly upon assumptions, no matter how certain others may be thatthe assumptions are correct.Accepting Things as They AreWhen you accept the presence of uncertainty, you can usually relax and enjoy lifemore. You dont feel that you have to have a final answer for everything. You acceptwhat you know and act upon it, without expecting to know everything else  past,present, or future.For example, theres nothing wrong with being in love with someone. Theresnothing wrong with enjoying that and making the most of it. Whats wrong is toassume that you know at this minute everything youd need to know to decide tocommit the rest of your life to such a relationship.For another example, if your income suddenly goes up, theres no sensible reasonnot to enjoy your new wealth. But it would be foolish to assume that you know thatthe income level will continue permanently and thereby commit yourself to futureexpenditures that depend upon that income.If youve found an eager market for your product or service, dont let thatconvince you that everyone will want that service. For that might lead you to makeinvestments in your business that are based upon unrealistic projections.Dont let uncertainty prevent you from enjoying what you have. But dont letoverconfidence lead you to act upon what you dont have yet.114Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThe Final AuthorityMany people go through life with the feeling that what they think and know aresort of summations of what theyve absorbed from those who really know things.This attitude is encouraged, of course, by those who are supposed to be the oneswho really know  moral authorities, experts, people who are older and wiser,people who are on the inside. They speak with convincing authority.But they, too, act and speak from incomplete information  just as we all do. Noone can hope to have all the information necessary to speak with final authority. Toexpect that is to fall into the Certainty Trap.The experts dont know everything, or even everything about anything. And onething they know very little about is you. The people who tell you how to live havevery little knowledge of who you are and what youre capable of doing.But you can know those things  if not totally, then far better than anyone elsecan. This is why you have to filter information before taking it into your system ofdoing things.You have to judge how sensibly the information fits with the way you see theworld, how compatibly the action suggested fits with your nature and capabilities,how happy you might be if you lived in the way suggested.Its easy to think there has to be an authority outside yourself to judge what istrue or false, what is correct and incorrect, what will work and what wont. But thereisnt. Even if youd like to delegate that responsibility to someone else, you cant. You stillhave to decide who will be the judge, and sometime in the future you may change thatdecision.So youre deciding even when you try not to decide.Its important to recognize that you are the final authority  whether or not youchoose to be, whether or not you have the confidence to assume the role. The role isyours, regardless.You are the sovereign authority for your life. You are the ruler who makes thedecisions regarding how you will act, what information you will accept. You do itanyway  but if you recognize that you do it, you can gain much greater controlover your future.Once you know that the responsibility begins and ends with you, you starttreating information more carefully, you act more deliberately, and you get results thatmore directly bring you what you need to be happy.You live in a world of your own, bounded by your own knowledge andexperience. Its a wonderful world  full of the power to do things to bring freedomand happiness.The Certainty Trap115Recognize your sovereign authority. You wont ever be the totalitarian ruler ofsomeone elses life. But you do rule your own.When you no longer count on other people to be right, to be certain, to bemoral, to be intelligent, youll turn to the one source of genuine power that exists for you yourself.Youll find numerous alternatives that can get you what you want without having togo through people who disagree with you. Youll discover how much of your freedomand happiness youve forfeited in the past by delegating to other people the power thatcan be used effectively only by yourself.Who rules the world?You do. Your world, that is.If a man begins with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will becontent with doubts he shall end in certainties. Francis BaconThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. William ShakespeareThe best laid schemes o mice and men Gang aft a-gley. Robert Burns116Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World15You Can Be FreeIts easy to believe that you came into the world with a prearranged program youmust follow. After all, long before you arrived, other people figured out how you shouldlive, what laws you should obey, what your obligations are, the whole structure for aproper life.Most people accept that program. They try to find the proper rules and hope tofollow them faithfully. They do everything possible to live up to the images thatothers declare to be moral, rational, in, or acceptable.The tragedy is that each of them has only one life and he throws that life awaytrying to live it as someone else has dictated. He accepts the traps without question.He allows the world to act upon him  instead of creating a joyous world forhimself.As a result, he comes to accept as part of life many discomforts, problems, andaggravations. When he gets into a box, he accepts it as his lot.It is tragic.As you consider the prearranged programs that others hand you, remind yourselfthat you have only one life. Ask yourself whether youre willing to trust it tosomeone elses information, ideas, or plans. Are you willing to give up the one lifeyou have in order to conform to the way others think you should live?Your life is all you have. What could possibly be important enough to warrantthrowing that life away?Of what value is society if you must give up your happiness for it? Ofwhat value is your country if you must sacrifice your life to protect itfrom its problems? Of what value is anything if to preserve it you mustbend your identity?Nations, societies, communities, families, marriages, jobs, relationships  thesethings are all means to an end. And the end is your happiness. You can achievegenuine, durable happiness only when your own identity is preserved. How, then, canany institution be more important than yourself in your considerations?By bending yourself to fit the institutions, you turn things inside out. Theinstitutions must be created and utilized as they serve you  not vice versa.117When they dont add anything to your well-being, you have no logical reason tosupport them.If I were totally convinced that societys rules were well founded, sensible,and truly furthered societys interests, I would still refuse to give up myidentity and my happiness for them. For how could I value society if Imust sacrifice myself for it?As it is, however, the rules arent well founded. Theyre usually senseless clichs.Misguided attempts to follow them have resulted in wars, poverty, tyranny, violence, anddespair. But despite the evidence, plenty of people still place their faith in their society, intheir government, and in other institutions.The moral codes, the legal structure, the social customs, the assumedobligations, the norm  all those things are products of limited,subjective human perception. In some cases, they might coincide withgood sense, but it would be foolish to accept them without challenge.These traditions and customs have been informally codified in the clichs,assumptions, and standard practices that Ive referred to as traps. In the pastchapters, weve looked at fourteen basic types of traps (there are probably more thatI havent identified).By dismantling the traps, Ive been attempting to demonstrate that freedom ismore often lost by false assumptions than by the power of ones enemies.Its quite understandable that the traps carry so much influence. But they arepaper chains. And the individual who sees them for what they are will know that itwas his choice to be enslaved; he hasnt been overpowered.Hell know that hes been acting on poor information. But more than anythingelse, hell see that he has the power to step out of them and into a better life for himself.He doesnt have to use misguided methods to try to find freedom  such as aresuggested by the Government Traps, the Rights Trap, the Utopia Trap, the Burning-Issue Trap, and the Group Trap.He doesnt have to use inefficient decision-making methods  as seen in thePrevious-Investment Trap, the Certainty Trap, the Box Trap, and the EmotionalTrap.He doesnt have to forsake his own nature to get along  as dictated by theIdentity Trap, the Morality Trap, the Intellectual Trap, and the Unselfishness Trap.And if he avoids these traps, he has no reason to fall into the Despair Trap  thebelief that he cant be free.118Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldLife Is UnderstandableThe traps can make the world seem too big and complicated for an individual toact on his own. And that reinforces the individuals sense of helplessness, his feelingthat his life isnt in his own hands.Through it all, however, the world is quite simple.I find that when I integrate everything I see around two basic principles, it allmakes perfect sense: (1) Each person seeks his own mental well-being (happiness);and (2) Everything that happens is the effect of a prior cause.When you dont understand a situation, it helps to stand back for a minute, thinkof each person involved, and ask yourself, What is he trying to do? How does hebelieve hes furthering his own well-being? That can make his actions much moreunderstandable and predictable.It doesnt matter whether his conduct is right or wrong. Thats what hes doing.And youre not going to be able to re-educate him instantly.As you view the identities of others, you make it far easier on yourself if you accept themas they are. Attempts to change others are rarely successful, and even then probablynot completely satisfying.To accept others as they are doesnt mean you have to give into them or put upwith them. You are sovereign. You own your own world. You can choose.In any situation, ask yourself: Is this what I want for myself? If it isnt, you donthave to remain there. There are millions of people out there in the world; you have alot more to choose from than just what you see in front of you now.Your SovereigntyYouve probably heard all your life that there are things in this world moreimportant than yourself. If so, it can take time to accept the fact of your ownsovereignty. It can seem natural to assume that your future will be decided by others,that your purpose in life is to serve society, your country, or the world  asdetermined by others.But whether or not you accept it, you are sovereign. You rule one life  and yourule it totally.You decide which information you will accept or reject. You decide what yournext action will be. You decide what moral code youll live by.What has happened to you up to now in your life is far more the result ofyour choices than of anything else. Others have affected you, but you arethe one who decided whether or not youd associate with them.You Can Be Free119If youve acted upon information that later proved to be false, it was youwho decided to accept that information. If youve become involved inrelationships with people who later proved to be difficult, it was you whochose to become vulnerable to them. But it was also you who made all thechoices that led to the good things youve enjoyed in your life.You are the sovereign ruler who has chosen which city to live in, which job totake, which people to associate with, which rules to live by. Others may have maderequests  even demands  but it was you who made the decisions regarding youractions.But what is most important, it is also you who will make the choices in the future.Whatever you did in the past, you did for the best reasons you knew at the time. Buttoday, you have more alternatives to choose from. And tomorrow, youll have evenmore. Theres no reason why you have to repeat your choices of the past  unless theyproved to be best for you.What you do from here on will be entirely up to you. You will decide whether or not you decide to think of it in those terms.If you decide to believe that you have no control over your own life, then youllprobably choose to do as others demand  whether that be the government, society,friends, or family. And you might choose to place the blame for your misfortunes uponthem.But if you choose to recognize your own sovereignty, youll probably think itridiculous to grant others the responsibility for your success or failure.A free person would never consider it sensible to allocate the credit or blame for hislife to others. If the market for his services should change, it isnt a disaster to him.Hes been mentally prepared for that possibility  and he immediately looks forsomething new, while others might sulk over their poor luck.If the product he sells goes out of fashion, he looks for something that is indemand. If he finds that the city in which he lives no longer pleases him, he looks forone that does. If the government raises taxes, he looks for a way to avoid them. Ifsomeone tries to take his property from him, he takes steps to protect it; he doesntrely upon the police and then blame them for his unhappiness if they fail.He would never consider the possibility that his life is only what others decide tomake it.He recognizes that others will seek their own happiness  and in their own ways.And he knows that what they do may not be in his self-interest sometimes. He acceptsthat, without bitterness or accusations, and he relies upon himself.120Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldHe recognizes his own sovereignty, he values his own life above all, and herefuses to waste that life  or any part of it  by making others responsible for hisfuture.Your FutureThat free person has no advantages that you dont have. His freedom didnt resultfrom an accident of birth. His good fortune hasnt been a matter of luck.Hes free because he recognizes his most priceless asset, the same asset that youpossess  sovereignty.Every person is the sovereign ruler of his own life. But few people ever recognize thatfact. Those who do will make it their business to find freedom. Those who dont willinvariably resign themselves to whatever society makes available to them.Yes, you are the ruler of your life. You choose what youll believe, what youllaccept, what youll do.Youve chosen the path youve followed up until now. And youll make the choicesthat will take you from where you are now.What are you going to do with that power?Are you going to delegate it to someone else to write the rules for you? Or areyou going to create rules that will make your life as free and happy as possible?Are you going to stay in the boxes that confine you? Or are you going to make ita point to free yourself of anything thats uncomfortable for you?Are you going to be free?In the first chapter I defined freedom as the opportunity to live your life as youwant to live it. Most people visualize the fight for freedom as an attempt to break outof a physical or cultural prison in which theyre held captives.Its easy to feel that you lack the opportunity to be free because someone has thepower to enslave you and is using it. And so you try to reconstruct the social order oryour familys understanding in order to have the opportunity to be free.But those prison walls exist only because you have chosen to allow them tostand. They have no substance, no restrictive power  except as you choose toaccept them.You dont have to reconstruct the social order; you dont have to overpower thevillains; you dont have to re-educate the world; you dont need a miracle. All youhave to do is to use your sovereign power of choice to release yourself from thosewho would keep you in bondage.You Can Be Free121The opportunity has always been there. You just havent taken advantage ofit.So we can drop the word opportunity from the definition of freedom, because theopportunity already exists  and always has.Freedom is living your life as you want to live it.And you can do that by choosing to do so. You can be free. No one can stopyou.The gigantic myth called society that rules so many lives doesnt even exist.Society is merely a collection of different people, tastes, and judgments. It cantenforce its rules upon you. You dont have to uphold causes you dont believe in, goto cocktail parties that bore you, dress and act as youve been told to.You dont have to be married to someone who wants you to be something otherthan what you are. You dont have to work for a company that doesnt recognize yourtalent. And you dont have to stay in a profession that drains your time and prevents youfrom living as you want to.You dont have to reject your own interests and live by someone elses code. Youdont have to forsake your own happiness for the benefit of anyone. You dont haveto obey the laws that the majority has decided are right. You dont have to followthe leadership of politicians, prophets, or philosophers.You dont have to distort your emotions, tastes, and values to conform to thenorms others think are best for you.You are free to live your life as you want. You could get into your car right nowand drive to anywhere you choose. Theres nothing stopping you. The only reasonnot to do that is if there is something better for you where you are now.The demands and wishes of others dont control your life. You do. You make thedecisions. And the only standard should be to make the decisions that will bring youthe greatest happiness.There are thousands of people who wouldnt demand that you bend yourself outof shape to please them. There are people who will want you to be yourself, peoplewho see things as you do, people who want the same things you want.Why should you have to waste your life in a futile effort to please those with whomyou arent compatible?To be free, you have only to make the decision to be free. Freedom is waiting foryou  anytime youre ready for it.122Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldGetting ThereTheres still work to be done  perhaps a lot of it. Youll need specifictechniques to get you out of the traps and boxes without sacrificing your future to do it.Youll need alternatives so that you can avoid taxes without going to jail, live yourown life without having to be lonely, dissolve uncomfortable relationships with a minimumof emotional upheaval.Most of the rest of the book will be devoted to those techniques. All of them dealwith direct alternatives  choices you can make that dont involve changing otherpeople. The next section will provide alternatives to free yourself from the restrictionsthat are binding you now. And the following section will include techniques that willhelp you to make the transition to a free life.The goal is in sight. There are ways to retrieve the freedom youve disregarded.There are ways to spend more time feeling good and less time trying to ward offproblems, to spend more of your life choosing between exciting alternatives and lesstime trying to keep things from getting worse.Youll never be 100% free, because your limited imagination can always envisionmore good things than you could have in a lifetime. So youll always have to makechoices, recognize consequences, and keep your most important values uppermost inyour mind.But Id guess that the average person is no more than 10% to 30% free, and Ibelieve its possible for almost anyone to raise that to as much as 60% to 90%freedom.Thats a considerable change  and you can make the change if you direct youreffort where it will have the greatest effect  on the direct alternatives that youcontrol.The most wonderful part of it all is that its entirely up to you. You dont have todepend upon circumstances; you can create the circumstances that please you.Your success depends only upon your willingness to assert your freedom and toimplement it.Everyone begins life as a free person. But as time passes, most people accept theprearranged programs and never stop to realize the freedom they possess. They acceptstandards and situations that are unsuitable to them.You Can Be Free123But that doesnt have to apply to you. You can have your freedom back any timeyou choose to take it.You can be free.And nothing, not God, is greater to one than ones self is. Walt WhitmanSelf-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,These three alone lead to sovereign power. Alfred Lord Tennyson124Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldPart II125How You Can Be Free16Freedom from GovernmentMost people seem to think of the government as an all-powerful giant withunlimited resources, super powers of control and surveillance, and the ability to keepevery citizen in line.Such impressions are reinforced by movies and TV dramas that picturegovernment agents calling upon vast resources of information and manpower to bringany criminal or dissenter to bay. And the impression is probably enhanced bynewspaper accounts of crackdowns on narcotics rings, smuggling activities, and taxfrauds, in which the government has used large numbers of agents to break a case.All this can be pretty intimidating. But it has very little to do with yourrelationship to the government.For one thing, the government has limited resources  just as you and I do.When a large number of agents are utilized to break a narcotics ring, that leaves fewerpeople to police the average marijuana smoker. And when they marshal theirresources to crack a million-dollar tax fraud, that leaves less manpower to look afterthe normal individual tax returns.If the government were as powerful as people seem to think it is, the War on Drugswould have been won long ago, crime wouldnt be such a national issue, and thegovernments grandiose social reforms would be successful. As it is, however, noneof those things is true because the government cant force many people at once to actin ways they dont want to.The government is one big Group Trap. To be efficient, it depends upon millionsof bureaucrats whose incomes and careers dont depend upon efficient action.The people who operate the super-secret spy agencies are simply human beings with ulcers, family problems, interoffice memos to answer, staff meetings toattend, girl friends to see when they can sneak away from the office, office opponentsto outmaneuver, and the constant interferences inherent in any bureaucracy.The government is an inefficient, bureaucratic mess. It isnt surprising that itsprograms always turn out to cost more than expected, that it almost neversuccessfully completes a project, that bombers bomb the wrong cities in126Vietnam, that its usually rallying its citizens to be patriotic and sacrifice tocompensate for the governments mistakes.In the book 1984, George Orwell pictured a totalitarian society that has becomethe standard view of the total state of the future. Everyones life was controlled bycomputer, and there was a TV camera in every room to monitor everyones activities.Fortunately, such dramas overlook the fundamentals of economics. The largerthe government, the less efficient and productive is the economy. Slaves dontproduce with the enthusiasm, incentive, and imagination that free people do.Bureaucratic programs just dont work as intended.So while the totalitarian state may include a TV camera in every room, I doubtthat the camera will work.Three PrinciplesThe first principle in dealing with government, then, is: Dont be awed by it. Whatlittle the government achieves is almost always due to the voluntary participation of itscitizens. Those who dont want to help the government can go their own ways withoutrunning into much trouble.The second principle is: Dont confront the government. A sure way to makeyour life miserable is to attack the government head on. Its resources are limited, and itcant waste them tracking down every possible violator of every law. But it will certainlyaim its power at anyone who publicly defies it. So keep to yourself, do what youhave to do.The third rule in dealing with government is: Dont organize. Dont get a largegroup of people together to defy tax laws, promote ways of circumventing thegovernment, or openly violate regulations.By joining protests, you might wind up in jail. And you wont have muchfreedom there.And mass campaigns are easy targets. Thats where the government is likely todevote its limited resources. When many people are doing the same thing, its easy to stopthem by passing laws or by applying existing laws against them.When you act alone, however, youre usually not worth the trouble.Your PowerAnd when you act alone, you can flexibly do whatever is necessary to stay aheadof the government. If new laws are passed, you can change your methods to continuedoing what you want to do.Freedom from Government127No cumbersome, bureaucratic government can move as fast as an individualwhos determined to stay ahead of it.There are limitless possibilities for avoiding government  without crises, courtbattles, or fear of being jailed.Start by listing the governmental restrictions that inhibit your freedom. Determinethe possible consequences of ignoring them. It may be that no more than a warning isinvolved if youre caught. And you might also find that there are legal ways ofavoiding the restrictions  if theyre important enough to be worth the time toinvestigate.In many cases, you can just ignore the law without incurring dangerousconsequences. In others, you may have to go to more trouble  such as consultingan attorney or tax accountant.But act for yourself. Dont organize, and dont look to leaders to help you. Anyactivity big enough to require a leader is big enough to be noticed and attacked.Legal EvasionsFor most people, there are more than enough loopholes available to be able tooperate freely without running afoul of the law. More than anything else, it simplyrequires the determination to do so.For example, I know of a company that operates successfully in spite ofgovernmental regulations. The state in which its located has been trying to license itfor five years, and a federal agency has been trying to shut it down for violating aregulation. The state legislature even passed a special law to bring the company under itsjurisdiction.But to this day, the company still operates in its own way, pleasing its customers,and making profits for its owners. Theyve moved flexibly and easily into a differentmethod of operation every time a ruling has been made against them. Theyve had topay attorneys fees, but those are insignificant compared to the profits they would havelost had they given in to the bureaucrats.I once had a similar experience. I was operating a small business in California burdened with payroll taxes, bookkeeping requirements, and other regulationsimposed by the government. There were Social Security taxes, unemploymentinsurance taxes, disability insurance taxes, and income taxes to be paid or withheld.They cost me money and time, and they reduced the take-home pay of my employees.I regularly received notices from an organization whose purpose was to endpayroll taxes. They requested funds, of course, and they also wanted me to join a128Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldprotest movement to quit withholding taxes once the membership was large enoughto be intimidating.Naturally, I didnt get involved. Instead, I fired all the employees (includingmyself) and made contracts with each person for his services. Since I no longer hadany employees, I no longer paid or withheld payroll taxes.No bureaucrat called on me to find out why the revenue to the state had been lost.Meanwhile, the protest movement died its inevitable death, and other employerscontinued paying payroll taxes.The employees of my company received an additional benefit. They were nowindependent businessmen, selling their services to me, so they could designate theirhomes as their offices, coming to my office to perform services for me.As a result, each of them had far more tax deductions. He could claim as businessdeductions part of his household expenses, telephone bills, utility bills, car expenses,and other things that are normally considered to be personal expenses. Even with noincome tax withheld, very few of them owed anything in taxes at the end of the year.None of them bothered to file quarterly tax estimates, and none of them ran intoany trouble from the Internal Revenue Service.The simple change from employee status to that of independent contractorresulted in lower taxes for everyone concerned. Its a small and common example but there are probably millions of people who could use that loophole and dont.Its well known that there are thousands of millionaires who dont pay incometaxes. Some of them avoid property taxes as well. Occasionally, theres a hue and cry aboutit in Congress, but no effective changes are made. No tax law could be written (shortof 100% confiscation) that wouldnt have numerous loopholes. As one loophole isclosed, another opens up. Part of the reason may be that Congressmen dont like to paytaxes, either.Some people evade taxes by changing their citizenship and/or by operatingpersonal holding corporations through tax-free countries. If you make $25,000 or moreper year, its probably worth looking into. Others move to countries with morefavorable tax structures. Did you know, for example, that writers, artists, and othercreative people are exempt from income taxes in Ireland?The laws provide loopholes that allow individuals to establish personal taxfreefoundations that receive all their income and pay their personal expenses  withoutthe money being taxable to anyone involved. Unfortunately, a group of people triedto organize this method into a mass movement about five years ago, which resulted inoffsetting legislation. But the loophole is still used.Freedom from Government129Inheritance taxes can be legally avoided, too. Sometimes it requires only that propertybe co-owned or transferred prior to death. The important thing is to avoid the normalpostmortem legal processing of an estate.There are a multitude of ways to legally avoid taxes. I cant list them here or that woulddefeat their purpose. And you wont find them in magazine articles about taxes.Much of the information in those articles comes straight from the booklet thataccompanies your tax return. But once youre determined to cut your taxes, you shouldbe able to find the best ways for yourself.Other RestrictionsThe same principles apply to other governmental restrictions. If you just stay out ofthe normal channels of doing things, you can avoid conflicts with the government.Licenses and regulations can be avoided by using a little imagination. There areplenty of psychologists who are unlicensed and unregulated because they dont callthemselves psychologists. And there are plenty of people who do the same things thatteachers, doctors, architects, lawyers, beauticians, engineers, bankers, investmentcounselors, and psychiatrists do, but avoid all the legal requirements by not using thelegal titles.Such things as courtroom battles, jury duty, and the draft are ways by which thestate can drain your time and money. But there are always ways to avoid each of them.Many people avoid court procedures, for example, by having separate arbitrationcontracts with business associates, private marital agreements (without getting legallymarried or divorced), or appointing third parties to hold funds or arbitrate disputeswithout the normal legal expenses.Jury duty is typical of the impositions the state can make upon an individual. Manypeople avoid it by simply not registering to vote. Since the jury lists are called fromvoter lists, those people are never bothered. If voting is important to you, that maynot be the way to do it  but I quit voting ten years ago and havent missed it in theslightest.There are numerous legal ways to resist the draft. There are even manyorganizations that provide that assistance. If I were vulnerable to the draft, I wouldcheck with those organizations for techniques  but then Id consult an attorney tobe sure that the loopholes hadnt been closed by the organizations own activities.If you want to avoid taxes or regulations, there are always ways to do so withoutbeing vulnerable to bad consequences  no matter where you are, no matter whatgovernment youre dealing with.130Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldLegally or Illegally?Sooner or later youll have to make a decision regarding your willingness to obeylaws.Theres a normal reluctance to break laws. You can easily feel that yourecontributing to the decay of your country, or that youre making yourself vulnerable.However, there are thousands of once-rich Cubans who wish today that theydbeen willing to commit the crime of sending their funds out of Cuba before thegovernment confiscated them. They either thought they were helping their country bykeeping their funds at home, or they counted on laws they thought would preventconfiscation, or they didnt want to take the risks involved in smuggling their fundsout.Their views have been shared by people in countries all over the world  peoplewho always thought, Its different here. They failed to realize that no governmentobeys laws. It will change, overrule, ignore, or defy them whenever they get in its way.To count on the law to protect you is a grave mistake.Recognize, also, that you undoubtedly break laws continually. Its almostimpossible to drive a car without breaking traffic laws. And most other kinds of lawsare filled with contradictions that make nearly everyone a lawbreaker just by goingabout his own business.To determine whether or not to break a law, the only consideration should be theconsequences to yourself. What is the risk involved? What would happen if yourecaught? How much are you gaining by breaking the law?As you evaluate those consequences, dont overlook your own emotional nature.Dont do something that will make it impossible for you to sleep nights. The moneysaved may not be worth the anxiety.But dont be swayed by considerations of patriotism, law and order, or nationalsolidarity. Those things are only slogans designed to further the governments interestsat the expense of yours.In my own case, Ive had to handle things legally. By writing books like this one, Iforego the anonymity that would allow me more flexibility. Ive chosen to write thebooks and obey the laws because the books increase my income enough to make thechoice profitable.Your decision will be based upon considerations appropriate to you.Even if you do things legally, its still best not to advertise what youre doing.Often the legality of a technique is determined arbitrarily by a tax collector or a judge.If you flaunt your activities, that could influence a decision against you. And when aloophole is publicized enough, the government may move to close it.Freedom from Government131Illegal MethodsIf youre considering breaking a law, check first to determine the legalconsequences. It may be something that involves no fines or penalties  but it couldalso be something very costly. You should have that information before you act.For most things you might want to do theres probably little danger. All you needto do is to check the consequences and then go ahead and do it.A typical example of this is the regulation that prohibits American citizens fromowning gold. Many people are upset about it, and movements have been organized topressure Congress to legalize gold ownership.15Meanwhile, plenty of Americans go ahead and buy gold anyway. Some of themdo it legally by taking advantage of the loophole that permits ownership of gold coins.But others buy gold bullion without making a fuss about it.Several foreign bankers have told me that many of their American clients owngold bullion. None of them has ever been harassed or prosecuted by the U.S.government.In fact, to the best of my knowledge, no American has ever been fined or sent tojail for owning gold. If the gold is kept outside the country, it cant even beconfiscated. The few cases of governmental action have been against large companies,where millions of dollars worth of gold were involved.Taxes can be evaded in many ways, too. Some of those ways are risky, but manyof them involve very little chance of disclosure.I imagine that many individuals make sure that they receive a good part of theirincome in cash, and then report only enough of that to justify their general livingstandards. The rest is salted away somewhere.And Im sure there must be thousands or millions of people who have never filedan income tax return. They probably work in ways that eliminate the need to have taxeswithheld or the need to have a Social Security number.Many people use foreign banks to handle their financial affairs in ways that wontbe reported in the U.S. Others simply cheat on their returns in ways that dont involvepenalties.These and other methods will continue to be profitable  so long as the peoplewho use them dont try to get together and organize their activities. A little researchcan uncover a wide variety of avenues of tax evasion.Then there are all the little irritants of governmental regulation  compulsoryschooling laws, zoning laws, licenses, etc. If you gripe about them or132Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World15The prohibition against gold ownership was repealed in 1974.campaign against them, you probably wont get anywhere. But use a littleimagination and they dont have to control you.For instance Karl Hess decided he didnt want to attend high school  despite thecompulsory schooling laws. So he registered at two different schools, then filled outtransfer slips from each of them. Authorities at each school assumed he was at the otherand no one ever bothered him about it again.16There are many, many private schools operating now, in many parts of thecountry, that arent legitimized by the various state compulsory schooling laws. I know ofone in which all of its three hundred students are legal truants, and less than one half ofits teachers have legal credentials; but its high academic results have made the schoolpractically impervious to prosecution.If you want to start a new business, dont go looking for all the licenses andregulations youre supposed to observe. Just operate. Try to arrange your business sothat you can contact your prospects without public fanfare  and you may nevercome to the attention of the authorities. But if you do, the worst that could happen isthat youll have to do what you would have done at the outset anyway.Dealing with GovernmentAt some time you may need to decide whether or not its in your self-interest to dealdirectly with the government  accept subsidies, sell to the government, buy from it,or work for it.Such decisions are purely subjective, and you have to decide in a way thatcomfortably suits you.In my own case, Ive decided to avoid the government as much as possible. I usegovernment roads and the post office because the government has declaredmonopolies in those fields, and that makes the alternatives many times costlier. ButIve decided against accepting normal subsidies like free schooling, health care,mortgage guarantees, etc.In general, government services are usually of very low quality. I often wonder,for example, if no education might not be better than some of the free education Isee.Most people agree that you cant get something for nothing. And yet, I think theymight also assume that what they get from the government doesnt cost themanything. Theres always a price to pay, however. Even a thief who thinks hesobtained his haul cost free wont give you any of it without wanting something inreturn. And that goes for the government, too.Freedom from Government13316National Observer, March 1, 1971, p. 18.Government services involve obligations, red tape, and the need to put your nameon a list as a grateful recipient of the governments favors. The gifts are alwayspresented with plenty of strings attached; I dont want the strings, and I dont wantto depend upon something that may be taken away from me tomorrow.I dont think that most people recognize the strings and the prices, however. Andpart of the problem may come from thinking that money is the only cost to beconsidered.For example, Abbie Hoffmans book Steal This Book lists hundreds of ways ofgetting free goodies from the government  along with ways of cheating companies.But in most of the examples cited, you have to exert devious, risky, and involvedefforts to get the supposedly free benefits. For most people, it would be far lesscostly to pay the normal market prices of the stolen benefits.My life is less cluttered so long as I simply avoid the government whereverpossible. I find it easy to accept and pay normal prices as they occur  withoutwasting a great deal of time trying to circumvent the price by dealing through thegovernment.And, too, I see no reason to wage war against the government. Its employees aresimply doing what each thinks best for himself  just as Im doing for myself. Ourmethods may be different, but each of us is seeking his own happiness.So I see no reason to be indignant over new or old laws, no reason to campaignagainst injustice or inefficiency, no reason to waste my life fighting something thatsalways been here and probably always will be.How you will deal with the government will be up to you. My observations havebeen mentioned only to illustrate the kinds of decisions one needs to consider inevaluating his relationship with the government.Your CooperationGovernments invariably call upon their citizens to cooperate in efforts for thepublic good. They want you to sacrifice to help solve economic crises, foreign-trade problems, and military conflicts; but these things were caused originally bygovernment intervention. Even so, the calls can seem compelling, and social pressurecan build on behalf of patriotic efforts.I dont believe you do anything for your country by fighting in a war (any war),giving up your money, or sacrificing in any way.The national economy is a typical example of the government trying to solve aproblem of its own making. During the past few years the American dollar has beensinking in international exchange, the economy has revealed critical134Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldproblems, and inflation has proceeded unchecked. Politicians and economists wouldlike you to believe that these problems are caused by gold speculators, greedybusinessmen, powerful labor unions, or weak regulations.Theyre not. Theyre the direct result of governmental interference in the economy.And any citizen who rallies to the governments solutions by rejecting his self-interest ismaking a futile sacrifice.No matter how the problems are explained, it is important to deposit your moneyin a foreign bank while you still can; it is important to withhold as much as possibleof your money from taxes. The economy will go its own inevitable way  regardlessof what you do. But at least you can protect yourself.Theres no reason for you to go under if the government does.17Whatever the issue, whatever the governments program, whatever the publicacceptance, you can always accomplish more for your own life by withholding yoursupport and using your resources on your own.But do it quietly and anonymously. Theres no reason to make a public issue of yourviews; that wont accomplish anything.FreedomIts not hard to be free of government  as long as you concentrate upon thedirect alternatives available to you. It requires only a little initiative and imagination.It may seem difficult, however, if you engage in political action to try to changewhat you dont like. You may feel quite helpless if you think you must convinceeveryone that things must be changed. But the objective of freedom is quite realistic;only the methods have been wrong.Dont be awed by the government.Dont confront it directly. Dontorganize.If you act on your own, legally or illegally, theres a great deal you can do to befree of the government. And theres no reason to feel ashamed, unpatriotic, wicked,or guilty about it.What you do to support the government contributes nothing to your own welfarenor to the welfare of society. What you do for yourself at least contributes to thehappiness of one very important individual.Freedom from Government13517My suggestions for protection are detailed in my book Fail-Safe Investing, which islisted in the Recommended Reading appendix.I like the way that Lysander Spooner put it:Whoever desires liberty should understand these vital facts, viz.: 1. Thatevery man who puts money in the hands of a government (so called), putsinto its hands a sword which will be used against himself, to extort moremoney from him, and also to keep him in subjection to its arbitrary will. 2.That those who will take his money, without his consent, in the first place,will use it for his further robbery and enslavement, if he presumes to resisttheirdemands in the future.18When you withhold money from the government, youre acting as you would whenyou lock your home at night to protect it against thieves. In either case, youre acting topreserve what is yours from those who would like to take it without your consent.And just as you can easily protect your home by using a watch dog, the rightlocks, or a burglar alarm, so can you protect your funds and your freedom from thegovernment  if youll direct your attention toward that goal.The savings can be tremendous. If you need any incentive, determine how muchyouve paid in taxes for the past year (or five or ten years), then make a list of all thethings you could have bought with that money.The freedom is yours, the money is yours, the opportunity is yours  once youturn your attention toward yourself.And your purpose will be as noble as any person could find  the advancementof your own happiness.136Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World18No Treason, p. 20.17Freedom from Social RestrictionsIts easy to feel that you have no chance to live your own life, that societyimposes too many restrictions upon you. Employers, friends, lovers, family, andstrangers seem to gang up on you to tell you how you must live.Of course, society is a nonentity. It has no mind, no interests, no motivations. It issimply a collection of many different individuals who have different minds, interests, andmotivations. So society cant restrain you.The problems come from individuals  people who want you to act in certainways and cause problems for you if you dont.I think that the first step in freeing yourself from social restrictions is therealization that there is no such thing as a safe code of conduct  one that wouldearn everyones approval. Your actions can always be condemned by someone  forbeing too bold or too apathetic, for being too conformist or too nonconformist, forbeing too liberal or too conservative.So its necessary to decide whose approval is important to you. If you just assumethat you must have the approval of those nearest to you, social restrictions will be avery real problem.But there are millions of people within your reach  people of all different types.Included in those millions are undoubtedly many people who wouldnt demand theartificial attitudes you may think you have to display. They would want you as youreally are.Ive often heard someone say that if such people exist, hes never seen them. But theproblem is usually that he hasnt looked in the right places, or that hes given thosepeople no chance to see him.If you want to find someone who is much like yourself in attitude, tastes, andinterests, you have to look where such a person is likely to be found. And you cantexpect him to recognize you if you hide your identity behind a mask in order to getalong with the people youre with.Obviously, if you like rock music, you arent likely to meet a kindred soul at theopera house. In the same way, if youre looking for someone whos honestly selfishand individualistic, youre not likely to find him at meetings of the local ImprovementLeague or the Young Democrats Club.137Whatever your personal standards, the best place to find like-minded people is thesame place where you would most like to be. If you crave companionship thats moreintellectual, for example, you might try college or night-school courses in the subjectsthat have always interested you.And since you could also run into potential friends almost anywhere, itsimportant to display your standards openly and honestly wherever you are. Only thencan others recognize you as a kindred soul. For if you wear a socially acceptablemask, those whom you seek will walk right by you. And those whom you do attractwith the mask will only add to the pressure that you be something other than yourself.If you make your own actions consistent with the standards you really admire,youll know which people are compatible  just by their reactions to you. Thosewho disapprove will seek someone different to be with, and those who have standardssimilar to yours will react favorably toward you.In effect, you let others tell you about themselves through their reactions to whatyou are.So its important to reveal yourself as you really are. If youre ambitious and show it,people who appreciate ambition are more likely to notice you. Or if youre careful torespect the property of others and clearly want the same treatment for your ownproperty, youre less likely to wind up with thieving or freeloading friends.When you act as you want to act, you stand a far greater chance of meeting thepeople who could be valuable to you. But when you let others determine your conduct,you acquire nothing but restrictions.The AlternativesAt this point, standing up for yourself might seem like a gamble with long oddsagainst you, but Ive never known anyone who did so without achieving beneficialresults. And this way offers hope and opportunity; hiding your identity offers nothing butmore restrictions.I think that many people hide their identity, tolerate restrictions, and remain in badrelationships because theyre afraid of being lonely. But I wonder what they mean bylonely. Arent they very lonely when they deal with people who dont understandand appreciate them? I know Id be lonely in such a situation.Ive also been lonely sometimes while looking for compatible people. But thatloneliness was usually short-lived and more than rewarded by the discovery of peoplewho wanted me for what I am. Around them, I am understood and appreciated in away I never could have been among people with different standards.138Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThere are many, many people in the world. You dont have to please any one person.There are other employers, other business prospects, other potential friends, lovers andspouses.And when you find them, youll have relationships that impose no restrictions uponyou. Youll be among people who will want you to be as you are.Your ValueAs you look for compatible people, it might be important to remind yourself that youhave more value to offer than those around you may have led you to believe. They mighthave rejected much that is a part of your nature (or would have rejected it if youdallowed it to be seen).That can lead you to believe youre out of touch with the world. And your lonelyfeelings can be aggravated as you look at the popular trends, fashions, and interests  ifthose things arent what you want.You can believe that if you dont dance the new dances, no one will think youremuch fun. Or if you dont join in the cries to save the environment, no one willthink youre very compassionate. Or if you havent been to an orgy, no one canbelieve youre with it.But the popular trends are only a part of the General Market. In fact, theyreusually not even representative of the majority of people; they are simply given a lotof publicity.There are plenty of people who dance in the old way  or who dont dance at all.There are undoubtedly millions of Americans who dont join social causes and couldntcare less about your involvement in them. And I suspect that plenty of people stillparticipate in sex on the old one-to-one basis.I once met a young woman who had very long, lovely, wavy hair. I complimentedher, but she replied that she was trying to straighten it. When I asked why, she said,Wavy hair isnt fashionable these days; everyone likes straight hair.Well, I much preferred her wavy hair, but then maybe I wasnt enough of amarket to please her. So I pointed out that in the city of Vancouver (where we bothlived), there were perhaps 100,000 eligible men and about the same number of eligiblewomen.If straight hair is more popular, maybe as many as 90% of the men prefer it. Ifmost all the women have straight hair, those 100,000 women will be competing forthe attentions of 90,000 men.So she could be one of 100,000 women competing for the attentions of 90,000men. Or she could leave her hair the way it is and be uniquely attractiveFreedom from Marriage Problems139to 10,000 men. The odds are far greater in her favor when shes in a minority thanwhen she tries to be part of the majority.What she didnt realize was that her differences can often be her most powerfulmarketing assets. Theres no reason to create artificial differences, but theres also noreason to suppress natural differences. By being willing to be in a minority, she could doaway with most of the competition for the market that was hers.Finding OthersWhat you are is the most valuable asset you possess for finding others.And the best way to find those people is to advertise what you really are. Not byrunning an ad in the newspaper, but by being honest about who you are.No matter where you go, you never know if someone youre seeking might seeyou. What a shame it would be if that person passed you by because you didnt revealthe qualities that both you and he admire most.To reveal those qualities, you have to be willing to accept the disapproval ofthose you arent seeking. It takes courage to overcome the embarrassment, self-consciousness, and even ridicule that might result from honest exposure of yournature  at first. But that shouldnt last long; soon, youll form associations that arefar more rewarding than what youve tolerated in the past.If youve been hiding your collection of James Bond books for the sake of yourcultural friends, get them out, go to 007" movies, and be free to enjoy yourself andfind the people who wont pressure you. Chances are you wont miss the evenings ofculture and youll soon forget the people you werent in tune with.And why should you suppress your desires when youre having sexualintercourse? That way youll never experience it in the way you dream of it. Do it theway youve always wanted to do it  cry or laugh or shout if you want to  ask forwhat you want. Sure, someone may laugh at you, deny you, or even condemn you.But is that the person who can fulfill your dreams? One of these times someonesgoing to respond enthusiastically and gratefully  and youll know youve foundsomeone wonderful.The best method of advertising is simply to live the way you want to live.Once you see the benefits of doing things your way, you may want to extend thispractice to every area of your life. You might be encouraged to start handling your jobthe way youve always wanted to but for which youd assumed there was no market.And you might take seriously the thought that somewhere out there is someonewith whom you could happily spend the rest of your life.140Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldYou are what you are. Your greatest pleasures will be those you experience whenyou can be yourself completely. Only then will you be free to enjoy every good thingthe experience has to offer you. And youll be more likely to find those experiences ifyou act sincerely at all times.Being yourself is actually a skill. It takes time to become thoroughly acquaintedwith yourself, to throw off a lifetime of pressures, to relax and accept what you see inyourself (no matter how it may conflict with social standards), and to learn to act inways consistent with your nature.Advertising is a skill, too. It takes practice to learn how to advertise yourself. Thereare techniques to acquire and to practice until they become comfortable.One of those techniques is to emphasize your differences. Try to reveal frequentlythe things about yourself that distinguish you from most others.Your best prospects will respond when they see in you something they want thathasnt been available before. So advertise what makes you unique and what is mostimportant to you  and those who respond favorably will most likely be the onesyoure looking for. If others respond unfavorably, theyre simply disqualifyingthemselves from your interest.What is commonly thought of as good advertising is usually not very effectiveadvertising. Superlatives  words like best, quality, or sensational  have littleimpact. Most people know intuitively that it may not mean best for the prospect.Good advertising isnt flashy or imposing. Simply learn to reveal your qualities asthey are appropriate to the situation. Let your differences be brought out inconversations  without urging your uniqueness on others.I can give you a good example. For years, whenever it was appropriate inconversations, lectures, and writing, Ive casually mentioned one or more things suchas: Im single; I have no interest in governments, groups, crusades, or religions; Imcrazy about opera and other forms of classical music; Im lazy and have learned to live withit and enjoy it; and I see nothing wrong with beingselfish.19Im never evangelical about these things. I simply let them be known, one at a time,as appropriate.Of course, I could join in the usual conversational attacks upon greed andselfishness, act as if I were a fervent believer in God and country, show my interest inthe prevailing social issues. But where would that get me? My competition would beoverwhelming and my rewards inappropriate to me.Freedom from Marriage Problems14119See how easy that was.Far better to be honest. By doing so, Ive been approached by many individualswho were glad to find that they had a friend in what they had thought was an alien world.In fact, Ive also made many friends whose ideas are considerably different frommine in some matters. Theyre quite willing to accept the things we have in common andleave the other matters alone. They dont pressure me to change my views  probablybecause Im not self-conscious about them and therefore not a likely convert.A Natural MonopolyAs Ive indicated, far from cutting down your market, revealing yourself as youare increases your best market  whether youre concerned about personal orbusiness relationships.I was once asked by another writer if the uniqueness of my ideas didnt make melonely. Wouldnt I feel more comfortable if more writers agreed with my views?Obviously, no. My ideas may be the opposite of the popular views, but thatdoesnt mean theres no market for me. My market is bigger than it would be if I joinedthe crowd in an attempt to sell the more popular viewpoints.My first book, published in 1970, suggested that the dollar would be devaluedand that the economy was in bad shape  the opposite opinion from literally dozensof contemporary books on the subject. By looking only for a publisher who alreadyshared my viewpoint, I spared myself the grief of being rejected by the more orthodoxpublishers. The second one I contacted bought the book eagerly.When it was published, it far outsold any of the books that expressed the morepopular opinions. The other authors may have felt comfortable in their conformity, butthey didnt make as much money from their books.Should I feel sad that I held the minority opinion? There were literally millions ofAmericans who felt as I did about the future and who wanted suggestions for dealingwith a sagging dollar and a vulnerable economy. They were an eager market and I wasthe only one offering anything to it.Theres no one in the world exactly like you. And when you find the market thatwants what you are, your position is as solid as you could ever hope for. You have anatural monopoly in that market  one that exists just because of what you are andrequires no artificial devices to limit competition.When you fight to compete with the crowd, competition is all around you andtheres no way you can keep it out. But when you emphasize what you are, yourmarket wont want anyone but you.142Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldWhen you find the lover whos been looking for you, you wont need to restrictcompetition in any way  for no one else will be able to provide what that personneeds most. Any exposure to others will only point up your unique value bycomparison.When you emphasize your unique professional talents, your customers wont beinterested in the competition because it wont be offering what you offer.In any area of life, you have a natural monopoly of the unique combination oftraits that you possess. The only effective way to rule out competition is to find themarket that wants your traits above all others. And youll find it and keep it by havingthe courage to stand up for what you are.When you find that market, youll wonder why you ever restricted yourself inorder to get along with those who were incompatible with you.Dealing with RestrictionsMost social restrictions are self-inflicted. Your life is yours to live as you choose.If you give up what you want because of someones disapproval, you have onlyyourself to blame  because you made the choice; he didnt. He told you what hewanted, but he has no power to enforce it.You can do with your life what you want. You dont have to work at a normaljob. You can try your luck at anything. Do you want to be an artist? Tour guide?Gigolo? Do what you want to do  so long as you can make enough to survive whileyoure doing it.You dont have to spend money on a new car and a respectable home to impressyour neighbors, business associates, and friends. Why should you? Let them eat TVdinners in their new cars while you use your money to take the vacation youvealways wanted.Do you want to grow a beard or have longer hair? Do it. If your employer objects,look for a job where thats not a problem. Dont expect your employer to forsake his self-interest for you; but neither is there any reason for you to forsake yours for him.If your social contacts object, so what? How important are they to you? If theirapproval is based upon matters of fashion, are you sure they have anything to offeryou?Is it necessary to go to parties and attend other social functions in order to beaccepted? That depends upon whose acceptance youre seeking. Go where you wantmost to go; youre most likely to meet the people you seek there.Do you want to smoke marijuana? Do it. Since its legally prohibited, dont do itat the Policemans Ball  but that might not be where youd expect to find newfriends anyway. Dont make a social movement out of your personal tastesFreedom from Marriage Problems143and you wont get into trouble. Just smoke it quietly with those you value and trust.Do some people get upset when you express your emotions  if you cry whenyoure moved, laugh when you see something ridiculous? Dont be bullied by those whosay you shouldnt be so emotional. Find those who understand such things and appreciateyour honesty.Do those in your social circle make you feel pressured to live up to certain intellectualstandards? If so, you may be in the wrong place. It might be that you havent yetaccurately identified your own beliefs and standards  and these people seemed to be ofthe type you wanted. One way to tell is by noticing if that kind of pressure exists. If itdoes, keep trying to recognize yourself more clearly, and then look for people like that.There isnt any society to disapprove, to disallow, to denounce or toostracize you. Its a myth. I wonder how many millions of lives have beentossed on the junk pile to appease an entity that never existed.Be honest with yourself and with others and act toward others as youd like to betreated, and youll have a far greater chance to attract people valuable to you. Theothers are unimportant to your future  if your future is to be free.Theres a beautiful world out there. Why clutter it up with relationships that dontbelong in your life?Its an easy life. Why complicate it by trying to be all things to all people? Adoptthe image thats most effective  your own.144Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. Ralph Waldo Emerson18Freedom from Bad RelationshipsWeve seen that its foolish to waste time trying to deal with incompatible people.There are plenty of people around who would want you to be as you are.That doesnt mean, however, that youre likely to find individuals with whom youllbe 100% compatible  with the exact same tastes, values, attitudes, and ideas that youhave. Youre more likely to find individuals with whom youll have one or more importantthings in common.In the areas that you have in common, youll please the other person most by doingwhat you want to do. Thats the way it should be. No sacrifices are required by eitherperson.Such relationships can make your life far more exciting. They provide somethingto look forward to, something to enjoy, and the wonderful glow that comes fromknowing that someone else is seeing and enjoying things in much the same way youdo.Unfortunately, such good relationships often deteriorate into bad ones. What wasonce a good friendship can deteriorate into a relationship of obligations, conflicts, anddistrust. A love affair that started with an ecstatic glow can degenerate into a forumfor arguments. A business relationship that began as a source of opportunity can decayinto a bitter conflict of interests.Why do such things happen? Is it because no relationship can be expected to last?Is it just impossible for people to get along indefinitely?I dont think so. I think the problem has to do with the way relationships arehandled. Once again, too many assumptions are taken for granted  and they createproblems because the assumptions arent realistic.Labels againThe biggest problem probably stems from the ease with which you can label arelationship and then, in effect, treat the individual as if he were the label. One iscalled a friend or partner or lover or wife. And the labels imply subtleexpectations concerning the role the person is expected to play in your life.145For example, a friend is someone wholl lend you money when youre introuble; a wife is someone wholl cook, clean house, make love when you want to,and center her life around your family.But what the label requires may not be in the self-interest of the person involved,so conflicts can result. Loyalty is demanded and the relationship becomes a sourceof aggravation for everyone concerned.Suppose you meet someone, become friends with him, enjoy his company for severalweeks, and then are confronted with a request to take care of his Great Dane while heson vacation. Thats the beginning of a new relationship. What had previously beencompletely beneficial to you now becomes a source of obligations and conflicts of interest.Youll never be able to relax completely and enjoy that person again.If your wife makes friends with a neighbor and then expects the two families to taketheir vacations together, you may wind up taking your vacation in the Group Trap.The individuality of all the other members of the families will be eroded by theattempt to enlarge upon a simple enjoyable relationship between two women.If you expect your secretary to wait on you hand and foot, do your Christmasshopping for you, and lie to your wife when youre out of the office, youre probablyasking for more than she bargained for, and you may lose what you had hired  a goodsecretary.Relationships can be fruitful only when theyre in the self-interest of each person.Unfortunately, the normal labels and assumptions go far beyond that  and soproblems develop.In this chapter, well explore the general principles that can keep goodrelationships from falling apart. And in the next four chapters, well apply thoseprinciples to love affairs, family situations, and businesses.PrinciplesThere are three principles that I find helpful to remember:1. Dont think in terms of groups. As we saw in the Group Trap chapter,groups dont think, act, or have motivations; only individuals do. Itsmisleading to think of a group as being of one mind and purpose.Each individual is different from every other individual.2. Limit the relationship to what you have in common. Dont expectmore from the relationship than what is in the self-interest of eachperson involved. When you extend the146Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldrelationship beyond the areas of mutual self-interest, someone willhave to sacrifice.3. Dont attempt to perpetuate a relationship by contract. Change isinevitable. Alternatives, knowledge, and desires change. Anyrelationship should last only as long as its beneficial to each party. Ifan individual is required to continue in a relationship past the timeits beneficial to him, he loses. And it wont be possible for him tosatisfy the needs of anyone else in the relationship if hes acting out ofduty and not enthusiasm.Dont make the relationship an end in itself that must be perpetuated at all costs. Thatwill lead to demands for sacrifices in the name of making our marriage work, keepingour friendship, or making the business succeed. Relationships are only means to theends desired by each of the people involved; when the ends are no longer served, therelationship should end.In commercial situations, contracts are sometimes required. This is usuallybecause the supplier doesnt want to make a given investment unless hes assured ofan appropriate return on his investment. This can be handled, however, by includingin the contract a provision for early termination, accompanied by a cash payoff thatprovides the appropriate profit for the investment made.The three principles are saying, in effect, dont make an institution of arelationship. Dont add inappropriate activities to it, dont try to fit it within atraditional context, dont add duties and obligations to it that are irrelevant to thedesires of the people involved. Let the relationship evolve as it will  as mutual self-interest leads it.Beer BustsLets apply these principles to an example. Suppose three men with theunimaginative names of A, B, and C find that they have something in common. Theydiscover that they all like to drink beer, and they enjoy one anothers company andconversation when they drink.Suppose they find that they greatly enjoy getting together on Saturday nights todrink beer. All well and good.Our first principle suggests that they are still individuals, not a group. Neither ofthem should allow his self-interest to be submerged into an artificial entity known asthe group.For relationships with one another are a small part of their lives. Each of themhas many, many interests and concerns apart from beer and conversation about thefootball scores.Freedom from Marriage Problems147And since each of them is a different person, their relationships with one anotherwill be different. A and B will probably have some things in common that B and Cdont have. To think of the group as a single entity might prevent A and B from takingadvantage of the common interests that concern only them.They might both enjoy bowling, for example. If they feel they can bowl togetheronly if its agreeable to C (who prefers golf), theyll lose an opportunity to add totheir enjoyment.There are actually three separate relationships  A and B, B and C, A andC.The second principle suggests that the relationships be limited to only what theparticipants have in common. To enlarge the relationships beyond the small areas incommon is to open the door to many conflicts of interest.For example, if A expects B and C to help him paint his garage (Whats a friendfor?), it will probably be a loss to all three. For one thing, B and C may be lousygarage painters; Mr. A might lose by not paying the necessary price to have it doneright.And for B and C, the relationship is no longer just good beer and goodconversation. Now it includes duties and obligations. No one will be able to relaxcompletely any longer, for hell never know when hell be called upon to set aside hisown self-interest. Even if he refuses such requests, it will be a strain on the relationship.The third principle says that you shouldnt try to perpetuate a relationship bycontract. In a burst of exuberance and good fellowship, the three buddies might agreeto meet together every Saturday night for the next ten years. But that would probably bea big mistake.For all three of them are changing constantly. Each of them is discovering newalternatives, new motivations, and new interests. One of them may decide that heprefers wine. Another might even meet a girl someday and decide that she offers himmore than his Saturday night buddies.To attempt to preserve the relationship by contract is only going to bend each ofthem out of shape. In fact, other common interests might be suppressed by the fixedstructure of the relationship; as long as theyre committed to one routine, they mightignore other things they could do together that would be more enjoyable.Each relationship should be taken on its own merits. The relationship shouldevolve as it will  with no preconceived goals, structure, expectations, or rules.Our friends A, B, and C dont have to share uncommon interests. They can limittheir relationships to the enjoyment of the things they do have in common (includingtheir dumb names).148Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThe beer-bust example is rather obvious. So much the better that it is. For thesesame principles can be subverted subtly and easily in more complicated relationships.And when theyre subverted, problems develop  and what was once a source ofpleasure and opportunity can turn into a loss of freedom.Take Things as They AreYoure bound to be disappointed when you apply labels to people andrelationships and then expect them to live up to the labels.Your definition of a friend may be considerably different from the one yourfriend has. What you expect from him may be far more than hes willing to give regardless of what you may feel youve done for him.Relationships dont have to be structured, perpetuated, tied down. Theyll workout best if you let them evolve as they will  limiting your expectations to what is,and continues to be, mutually beneficial.When you find a friend whos intellectually stimulating, enjoy him for theexcellent discussions you can have. But dont expect him to help rearrange yourfurniture or lend you money. Those things are separate parts of your life, not a part ofhis.If you need money and cant borrow it at a bank or finance company, dontjeopardize good friendships by appealing for money on the basis of loyalty. Offer termsthat would make it worth more to a friend to lend the money than to use it himself.Make sure the terms are such that hed be eager to be involved in the deal  even ifhis friend werent to be the borrower. If that isnt possible, go without the money; itprobably isnt as important as a good friendship.If you keep the three principles in mind, you can let each relationship grownaturally. Youll probably avoid most of the conflicts, arguments, and burdens thatmost people take for granted in their important relationships. The other person will bea positive benefit to your life.If the relationship grows and seems to be broadening, approach each new area ofmutual interest on its own merits. Dont lump activities together simply because youlike someone. Youll continue to like him more if there are no dealings between youthat arent entered for their specific value to each of you.If you find a friend thats closer to you than anyone youve known, dont get carriedaway and try to impose your separate, different tastes upon him. If you fall in love,dont expect that every interest, every decision, and every value will be exactly thesame between you.If you can accept the differences that exist between you and those you care for,you can make the most of what you have together. If you try to overcome the differences,youll only make it harder to enjoy the things you do have together.Freedom from Marriage Problems149Granting FreedomRecognize each person you associate with for what he is, what specifically he hasto offer you, and what he might value in you. Dont confuse the issue by bringing inexternal matters that can only reduce the value of the relationship.Relationships shouldnt be sources of restrictions. And they wont be if you takethem as they are.Perhaps the three principles can be summed up as one importantprinciple: Let others be free.Dont try to tie them down with obligations, loyalties, duties, commitments, orappeals for sympathy. Make it your policy that you dont expect anyone to do whatisnt in his self-interest.Dont try to restrict your lovers activities. Dont try to make your spouse giveup his interests for you. Dont give your friends reason to feel that you expectanything from them but what is in their self-interest to give.If you let others be free, youll be a rare person  and a valuable one. Youll bein demand because you wont create the conflicts and arguments that so many peoplehave had from others.Your freedom is just as important, of course. You have to learn to say no in away that doesnt create strain and conflict. When you learn that, others will usuallyrespect your individuality.Your freedom and the freedom of those you deal with are equally important toyou. If people come to you because they freely want to, youll receive more genuinelove, friendship, understanding, and appreciation than you could possibly get byasking for it or demanding it.Loneliness is never more cruel than when it is felt in closeproximity to someone who has ceased to communicate. Germaine Greer150Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World19Freedom from Marriage ProblemsThe greatest restrictions upon many people are those imposed by marriage andfamily problems.Some are dominated by parents. Others are trapped by duties and obligations torelatives. And others are entangled in the problems of raising children.The most common restrictions come from marriages. Conflicts of interest developbetween husband and wife; each feels that hes getting less than he wants out of life,perhaps because of restrictions imposed upon him by the other.There are probably no subjects as emotionally charged as those of marriage andfamily. The sanctity of marriage and the pressures of parents and in-laws are onlytwo of the many cultural expectations involved in these subjects.And labels seem to be applied more readily and restrictively here than elsewhere.A wife is expected to give up her career and her own interests on behalf of herhusband and children. A husband must be a good provider. And a son is someonewhos supposed to make his parents proud of him  by his parents standards, ofcourse.The problem, as usual, is a type of trap  the acceptance of labels and culturaldogmas without recognizing that there are better alternatives available by which anindividual can satisfy his desires.Love, closeness, affection, family opportunities  all these things can be enjoyedwithout having to build elaborate, restrictive structures that destroy the independenceof everyone concerned.Why People Get MarriedLets begin by noting why people get married. The most common reason, Isuppose, is because theyre in love. Labels can be very compelling, so its assumedthat once youre in love with someone, you should confirm it by getting married.That isnt the only reason people get married, however. I couldnt possibly thinkof every motive for marriage, but here are a few of the well-known reasons:1. To enhance a love relationship.1512. To confirm that one has won his lover  once and for all.3. To achieve social respectability (such as to prove ones desirability or tosatisfy ones desire to be known as the head of a family).4. To make sexual intercourse easily accessible. 5.To be financially supported.6. To avoid loneliness.7. To guarantee that someone will be around in ones old age. 8.To have children.9. To escape the need to do something more challenging with ones life.10. To have a housekeeper.There are other ways to satisfy these objectives, but its frequently assumed thatthe traditional marriage is the only way. So a license is obtained, a church is hired,some words are spoken, and vows are made.The lovers assume theyve made a contract with each other, but they havent.They have obtained the permission of the government to be married and signed acontract with it. And the government has decided many of the terms of therelationship  financial arrangements (property laws), sexual rules (adultery laws),legal responsibilities, inheritance matters, etc.If they ever decide to terminate the marriage, they will need the permission of thegovernment  which may or may not be granted. Not only that, the conditions fortermination may be different from what they were when they signed the contract.It isnt necessary to become involved in such legal problems to fulfill theobjectives of the relationship. Neither is it necessary to assume the normal burdensthat accompany legal marriages.A Better WayThere are better ways to handle things. Lets look at how the objectives of amarriage can be better achieved without a marriage. Well use the desire to enhancethe love affair as the example, and then look at the other possible objectives later.Lets imagine that you find yourself in a luscious romantic situation. Youreinvolved with someone who seems to be everything you want. Your attitudes towardlife are generally the same, you like to do many of the same things, you152Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldfind yourself thinking about him a great deal of the time, you see him as physicallyattractive, your body is alive in anticipation of sexual union, and you feel thewonderful glow that tells you youre in love.20With all these things going for you, you probably feel that this person is the bestfriend youve ever had. He understands and appreciates what you are and what youwant. Each of you accepts and understands the differences between you.Such a relationship is unusual  probably because most people never try to findsomeone so appropriate to themselves. But as long as were going to base this example ona love relationship, we might as well make the love as real and satisfying as possible.With so much going for you, I think its safe to assume that the most importantobjective would be to preserve that love. Once having felt such a wonderful glow, whodwant to take any chance of losing it?Making It LastTo make love last, lets see how the three principles we covered in the last chapterapply to the situation.1. Dont think in terms of groups.2. Limit the relationship to what you have in common.3. Dont attempt to perpetuate the relationship by contract.As the first principle indicates, you arent a couple, a twosome, or anything buttwo separate, individual human beings who have found a great deal to enjoy together.No real merger can take place  because its literally impossible to merge humanbeings  in thought, motivation, or emotion.What exists is an overlapping of interests, attitudes, and feelings. And the mostshould be made of that.But  as the second principle indicates  its important not to try to merge theuncommon interests. You cant destroy the nature and self-interest of an individual; ifyou try to submerge it by making the marriage an end in itself, or by making theuncommon interests common, youre bound to get reactions other than what youdhoped for.20Unfortunately, the English language doesnt include a separate word to refer to anindividual who could be of either sex. Instead, Ill use the words he or him in referringto someone who could be either a man or a woman. Ill trust youll make any necessarytranslation.Freedom from Marriage Problems153Youll have common interests that sometimes require that you consult with eachother to make decisions, but its a mistake to think that you have to agree on everything.To expect that is to make the marriage a compromise  and that leads to situationswhere one is expected to sacrifice for the other.Sacrifice is often regarded as one of the main factors in a successful relationship,but it leads to a loss of value for the participants. And if freedom is living your life asyou want to live it, we should hope for a better kind of relationship than one in whichthe participants must give up that freedom.In effect, the success of the relationship will depend most upon the waydifferences between the individuals are handled. Must they result in compromise or is there a better way? Well see.The third principle warns against trying to perpetuate a relationship by contract.Too often, its hoped that marriage will make permanent the love that one feels whenhe marries.Unfortunately, it doesnt work that way. Love isnt a trophy you can win at awedding and then place in a showcase to represent a permanent victory. Love is anemotion. Emotions are involuntary reactions that occur as a result of who you are andwhat happens to you.You cant guarantee the durability of an emotion. If you know yourself well, youre ina better position to predict your future emotional responses, but it isnt somethingyou can guarantee.You cant promise to love forever  and neither can your lover. Youll continueto love and be loved if each of you continues to provide what the others emotionalnature reacts to. If you dont get married, youll have to continue to be that veryspecial person in order to retain the others love. If you do get married, the situation isexactly the same.A contract to love can make it more difficult to get out of the relationship  becauseof the recriminations, accusations, and guilt resulting from broken promises. But itwont perpetuate the love that prompted the contract; so of what value is it?In fact, if you get married, it may be even more difficult to perpetuate the love because the pressure upon you to feel love may be greater by virtue of the promisesand expectations. And that pressure can make it more difficult to relax and enjoyeverything you have together in whatever way it unfolds.Its important, then, to keep things in perspective. Dont assume that yourseparate selves will no longer exist because youre in love; dont try to force intereststhat arent mutual into the relationship; and dont attempt to perpetuate it by contract.154Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIts especially important to keep things in perspective when youre consumed bylove. Its a wonderful, fascinating emotion  which means it can be harder to makedecisions with a clear recognition of the consequences.Enjoy the present to the maximum, but be careful about committing your future. Anda common example of the Emotional Trap is to commit ones future in an unrealistic waybecause of the love one feels in the present.If love is wonderful (as I think it is), then you should be particularly careful to dowhat will preserve it, not destroy it.And the key to achieving that will be to preserve the relationship as it is now.Dont change it from a love relationship to something else. Dont assume that yourlover should automatically become your business partner, your housekeeper, your fix-it man, your bookkeeper, your necessary companion in your separate interests, yoursocial image-builder or anything else. Keep him as your lover  just as he is now.If you want to retain the love you feel now, dont introduce into the relationshipanything that doesnt facilitate that love. Limit that relationship to matters of love not finance, household affairs, compromised interests, or duties.Making the Most of ItAs the love grows, you will probably want to take advantage of the deeperfeelings by finding ways to be closer than you were before. Thats the critical point ofthe relationship. At that moment, youll either find a way to satisfy the specific desireyou have  or youll take on a number of irrelevant obligations that have nothing todo with what you really want from each other. Which way you choose will be criticalto the future of the relationship.So decide first what it is you want. Do you want to live together? Have more timetogether? Sleep together? Enjoy sexual intercourse together?All those things can be accomplished without a legal marriage and withoutunrelated obligations that could inhibit the growth of the relationship and theindividuals in it.If you want to live together, the answer is to live together.That doesnt require a license, a ceremony, engraved announcements, a writtencontract, a blessing from anyone. All you have to do is to live together.In most states, there are no laws forbidding adults from living together (usuallyunless one of them is legally married to someone else).However, you wont avoid the problems of marriage simply by avoiding thelegalities. Many people who live together encounter all the same difficulties, conflicts,and loss of love that married people do.Freedom from Marriage Problems155Common-law marriage isnt the answer. The answer is to make it a non--marriage. And to do that means that you do nothing  nothing that would attemptto change the individuality you took for granted before the new situation developed.Most love relationships probably falter because the individuals in them are unableto handle the differences between them. A non-marriage recognizes those differences,allows for them, and thereby permits the feelings of love to grow rather than bestifled.Neither of you becomes a different person because of the relationship. You donteach become half of a union. Each of you is still an individual human being  withhis own nature, work, property, interests, and ways of doing things.To attempt to change that will drive you straight into the Identity Trap. You cantbe anything other than yourself; if you try to be, youll most likely lose the goodfeelings you once felt for the person who is now responsible for your having tochange. And to tell yourself that youll love someone whose presence requires thatyou be someone other than yourself is to drive yourself into the Intellectual Trap the attempt to make your feelings conform to an unrealistic pattern.Theres no reason you cant love each other and still remain two individuals. In fact, ifyou could change the nature of the person you love, youd wind up with someoneother than the person you fell in love with.One way love diminishes is through the vulnerability one feels to the differencesof the other person. If youre tidy and hes messy, the requirement that you live inchaos can eat away at your affection for the person who causes that chaos. If yourefrugal, it can destroy your good feelings for him if you have to watch him throwingyour money away.But none of that has to happen. It didnt happen before you married  or non-married. And it doesnt have to happen now.Two IndividualsAll you have to do is to continue the relationship as it was before  even ifyoure living together.Each person should continue each of his own interests that are separate from theothers. If you like country music and he likes jazz, keep your separate phonographsand play the music in separate rooms. If he likes golf and you like tennis, continueplaying your own games with the people you played with before.If the differences between you are too great, the relationship probably wouldnthave lasted without your living together  and it wont last now. But156Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldif the differences didnt get in the way before you lived together, they dont have toget in the way now. And they wont  provided you accept the differences and allowfor them.Each person should continue to have his time alone, his own friends, his owninterests. The time spent together should be preserved for those things you enjoytogether  so that every moment together is a joy rather than a burden.It is vital that each person continue to know that his life is of his own making  thathe can choose for himself without being vulnerable to the different decision-makingmethods of someone else. If one person must be dependent upon the decisions of theother, hes involved in an indirect alternative. He must make the other understand orcompromise or sacrifice. His freedom is lost through the Group Trap.The non-marriage recognizes the sovereignty of each person. In a non-marriage, noone expects anyone else to act in any way but in his own self-interest. The non-marriagerecognizes that you can find lasting love and happiness only with someone with whom thedifferences arent great enough to make a lasting relationship impossible. And the non-marriage allows for those differences that do exist to continue without sacrifice of self-interest.In a non-marriage, you simply continue being the person you were before youstarted living together. You continue to work where you want to work, pursue theinterests that concern you most, and at the same time enjoy the opportunity to becloser to the one you love.PropertyThis means you retain your own property, your own income, and make your owndecisions. Theres no need for joint decisions, because each decision will primarilyconcern one person and only incidentally the other.Its just as unrealistic to merge your property as it is to try to merge your minds.And property is very important. The control of your own property is the mosttangible expression of your freedom.Its as important as your time  because, in fact, its the same thing as yourtime. When someone destroys your property or steals it or usurps your decision-making control over it, he has taken from your life the amount of time necessary toearn that property or to replace it. If an individuals time is important, his property isjust as important.Only when you can control your time and property with direct alternatives areyou free. If you must compromise your control by gaining someone elses agreementto use it, you dont really own it. And to whatever extent your freedom iscompromised, your lover doesnt represent a positive value in your life.Freedom from Marriage Problems157If each party to a relationship continues to be sovereign and control his ownproperty  and to respect the same for the other person  most of the typicalproblems of marriage will never arise.ArrangementsThe fact that you live together doesnt have to interfere with that in any way. Each ofyou can continue to own what he has had before and to acquire new things. You wouldntexpect to control your neighbors property  and theres no reason to control that ofyour lover.You simply continue to treat each other as you did before you started living together.You never expect the other person to forfeit what is his for your sake.As new situations develop, you can handle them as you would with anyone else.As things arise that concern both of you, you can make mutually beneficialarrangements between you. And, needless to say, no arrangements should be madethat arent mutually beneficial.If you want to live in the same home, make an arrangement. Some people handleit by splitting the household expenses down the middle. Im not too fond of thatarrangement because it involves joint decisions  such as how much will be spent, towhom, and for what.I think its better for one person to supply the house or apartment (either buyingor renting), provide the utilities, cleaning services, etc., and then be a sub-landlord whorents to the other. The sub-landlord then has the responsibility to see that things aretaken care of through his own decisions. None of your precious time together is wastedtrying to decide how large a sofa you can afford.If the sub-landlords methods are unacceptable to the other person, then you arentgoing to get along very well, no matter how you handle it. But this way less time iswasted taking care of decisions that could more easily be made by one person alone.The sub-rent should be negotiated to determine a price acceptable to both. Again,if you cant agree upon a price, then you wouldnt have been able to agree how muchmoney to spend if you had pooled your assets.In other words, if differences show up in this type of arrangement, they wouldhave shown up anyway. And this way, the differences can be handled much moreopenly, with a greater chance to be resolved without lingering resentments.Neither one should expect the other to give up his self-interest. Theres no reasonto be upset if you cant negotiate a particular new arrangement easily. You canalways revert to your previous arrangement and continue to enjoy each other as youdid before.158Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf you respect the sovereignty of your lover, youll approach each newarrangement in the way you would with an outsider  with full respect for theothers self-interest. If you want your lover to keep house for you, youll offer himenough to make it worth his while; you wont expect him to do it because of a labelattached to him, or because he should give a little.If both parties want to work outside the home, the sub-landlord can arrange forperiodic cleaning, a cook, or a housekeeper  and the sub-rent can reflect thatservice.I strongly suggest that the housekeeping be done by a third person. Too often itsassumed that we cant afford outside help, and the enjoyment of the relationship isjeopardized to save the few dollars involved.Anything that comes up can be handled. All you have to do is to remember thesovereignty of each person, and youll usually see a simple, obvious, natural way ofhandling every question. Just ask yourselves what you would do if you werent livingtogether, and that will probably suggest a simple solution.Differences can be handled very easily that way. For example, if one of you ismessy and the other tidy, you can have separate rooms within your home. You can stillsleep together whenever you want to, but you wont have to live in a room thatdoesnt conform to your life style. The cost of the extra room will be insignificant if ithelps to preserve the best of your relationship.If you were living separately, youd have to pay for separate rooms. If youre livingtogether only to save money, then the preservation of your love is secondary. But ifyoure living together to enhance your love, that should always have the highestpriority.RulesYou can build your relationships with each other in any way you choose. There isonly one rule in a non-marriage: Dont ask either person to sacrifice his sovereignty.Dont create situations that require joint control of property, time, or interests. Alloweach person to live and grow and develop as his own self-interest leads him.Other than that, theres no guidebook. What others choose to do might be bestfor them; but youll have to determine whats best for you. Your relationship will beunique, because each of you is unique.Always keep in mind that youre together because you love each other  andonly for that reason. Keep all other relationships separate. If your lover is your sub-landlord, keep that relationship with him separate from your love relationship.Freedom from Marriage Problems159If you want your lover to stay home and keep house for you, dont appeal to hislove for you. Appeal to his pocketbook and offer him what he needs to make it worthhis while.If your lover doesnt enjoy the same forms of entertainment you do, let eachenjoy his own  and reserve your time together for the things you do enjoy together.If you keep other things out of the love relationship, it will have a far, far betterchance to succeed. Simply approach the matter as if you were single individuals(which you are), without accepting any of the normal assumptions concerningmarriage. With that in mind, you can always work out arrangements that will suiteach of you.SeparationIf you should ever decide to part, you can part friends. You wont be involved inany of the financial haggling, accusations, bad feelings, desires for revenge, andrecriminations that accompany most marital breakups. Each is still his own person withhis own life and property; theres nothing to be untangled.But by retaining the individuality of each person, its more likely that the lovebetween you will grow and deepen, rather than wither  as is normally expected. Ifyou cant make it this way, its extremely unlikely that the love would have survivedin a normal marriage.Just imagine the kind of relationship youll have. Youll be living with someonewhos there because hed rather be there than anywhere else in the world.Youll be free of the nagging conflicts that many married people take for granted.You wont be subject to the bad consequences that Group-Trap relationships create.Youll be responsible for yourself; you wont be a 50% partner in a collective you cantcompletely control.The time you spend together will be devoted to enjoying each other  instead ofhaggling over details.I think youll find, too, that youll have far fewer financial problems than mostmarried couples have. The respect for sovereignty tends to eliminate most of theexuberant overspending that can characterize a marriage. You wont be relying uponthe other person to bail you out of your financial problems. Youll be less likely toinvolve yourself in long-term mortgages and contracts  something married couplesdo easily because of the alleged permanence of the relationship.160Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldInstead, youll be more likely to enjoy each day as it comes  making the mostof it without committing your future to satisfy emotional whims of the present.Youll be living with your best friend  wholl continue to be your best friendinstead of becoming your adversary. If theres a problem in the relationship, your bestfriend will want to know about it, to work with you to correct it if possible.Neither party will feel that his burdensome marriage is his lot in life, so that hemust suppress his resentment and put up with it, thus letting it get worse. Since hedoesnt feel trapped, he wont feel that he has to try to take advantage of the otherperson  in order to make the best of a bad deal.When you dont have to depend upon the other persons agreement to live as youwant to, you can be far more benevolent toward him, far more understanding of him andhis problems, far more anxious to do whats possible to help him make things right.In such circumstances, the initial feeling is more likely to grow and reach new levels ofaffection and excitement.And none of this involves sacrifice or compromise. Why so many people think ahappy marriage is based upon sacrifice, Ill never know. Life is to be lived, notsacrificed. You love someone because of the way he makes you feel, because of theway he enhances your life. If what you are doesnt do the same for him, no amount ofsacrifice is going to make things right.Ive seen several non-marriages that are based upon this respect for self-interestand sovereignty. Invariably, they are simpler, more loving, more enjoyablerelationships than the traditional kinds in which the participants must spend so muchtime working out decisions with each other.Existing MarriagesIf youre already married, the same principles can be used to enhance yourrelationship.If you honestly believe you already have the perfect relationship, skip over to the nextchapter, for I have nothing to offer that might improve upon perfection.But if you see ways in which the arrangement Ive described could improve yourrelationship, its not too difficult to convert to such a system. Only three things arerequired:1. Terminate the legal contract  so that you have a two-way relationshipinstead of a three-way contract with the government. That means getting a divorce which is only a legal formality.Freedom from Marriage Problems1612. Divide the property so that each thing is owned by one person or the other,thus recognizing individual sovereignty and removing the need for most joint decisions.Several ways to do this are described in Chapter 31.3. Do everything possible to make it easy for each of you to be totally honest withthe other. That will be the hardest part but also the most rewarding. Self-interestscant be served if they cant be expressed. Once youre free to discuss everythingopenly and unashamedly, problems should be much more easily resolved.Recognize that you dont have to do everything together. Each can pursueinterests that are of no concern to the other. Think of yourselves as independentindividuals who gain from being together in ways that are mutually satisfying.Love Can TriumphWeve based this example of a non-marriage on a relationship that has love as itspremise. At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned nine other common reasonspeople get married. If you look over those reasons again, I think you can easily seehow they would be affected by this type of system.If the individuals freedom is important, he can achieve his objective through anon-marriage better than through a marriage. If his freedom isnt important, a normalmarriage might be more advantageous  but such matters are outside the scope ofthis book.The romantic legends of those who live happily ever after are always treatedskeptically because it isnt normal for romance to last indefinitely. Its assumed thatthe initial glow and excitement will fade away with time and a more maturerelationship will replace it  which is just a polite way of describing an uneasycompromise.Such things are the rule because individuals are usually squarely in the EmotionalTrap at the time important long-term decisions are made. Their romantic notionsdiscourage them from wanting to think of what the relationship might be like a fewyears hence if handled in the normal ways.Consequently, the romantic notions dont last very long. The romance fades andfurther confirms the opinion that love is at best a temporary thing.But love, romance, excitement, and respect are possible. They can grow ratherthan shrink. When you remove the clich structures and attitudes, youre free to loveeach other, free to allow the seeds of your love to bloom and prosper  instead oftrampling them under in the name of duty or marriage or sacrifice or socialresponsibility.Its not difficult to use and enjoy both of your mental capabilities  youremotions that can bask in the pleasure of the present and your intellect that can162Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldprotect your future. If youre infatuated with someone, enjoy it to the hilt  its awonderful feeling. But dont commit your future; theres no reason to.If you know yourself well, you can eventually find the person whose self-interestmost nearly matches yours. And when you find him, youll have a future. But you neverhave to make the decision. You dont have to make a commitment, a plunge, anirrevocable decision of any kind.Just let the relationship grow and develop on its own merits. Let things evolve asthey will. If you reach a point where it seems you have more to gain by living together, do it.But you dont have to sign your life away for that; it just isnt necessary. To do so isto create a pressure for success that can be a significant way of destroying the naturalaffection you feel for each other.Let things evolve. If youre with the wrong person, marriage wont make it right.But if youre with the right person, you may wake up one day to realize that you dohave a lifetime relationship. Even then, there will be no decision to be made  allyoull have to do is to enjoy what you have.Youll get to that point only if you recognize each of your sovereignties. Thatmeans recognizing the importance of his freedom as well as your own. Not a freedomthats grudgingly granted or negotiated by trading restrictions or privileges but afreedom thats encouraged and taken for granted.The more free, the more independent, the more an individual your lover is, themore hell be capable of loving  loving you.And the more hell value you, because youll be one of the rare individuals whosable to let him be free.To be genuine and profound, love depends upon freedom. For one example, only freepeople can afford to love without reservation, to unleash all their emotions in thesupreme act of enjoyment  sexual intercourse.Other people enjoy sex, or dont enjoy it, as just another part of life. They have toremain on guard always, on the lookout to be sure this brief escape doesnt lead tofurther bad consequences.The free individual knows who he is and why hes where he is. He doesnt haveto hold back anything. He can be loving, affectionate, and understanding because heisnt threatened or vulnerable. Isnt that the kind of person youd like to have love you?Love is too valuable to allow it to be killed by marriage, social pressures, or anyother restriction.To me, love is the most exciting thing in the world. The joy of having onesthoughts and emotions filled with another person is the most wonderful experiencethat life has to offer. Its the culmination of everything else. All other enjoyment valuesseem to lead inexorably to the moment of sexual intercourse with the person whorepresents everything one wants in life.Freedom from Marriage Problems163Nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of that.O you and I what is it to us, what the rest do or think? What is all elseto us, who have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy? Walt Whitman and Frederick Delius164Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World20Freedom from Jealousy ProblemsJealousy is perhaps the most difficult problem in a romantic relationship. Its hard tolet someone be free if he uses that freedom in ways that hurt you.Theres no easy cure for jealousy; you wont eliminate it by saying you shouldntfeel jealous. But some of the problems caused by jealousy can be eliminated  andthis, in turn, can alleviate some of the bad feelings.Jealousy is the negative emotion caused by the fear of losing someone (orsomething) to someone else. Envy is of a different character; its the desire forsomething possessed by someone else. Envy is simply an intellectual recognition ofwhat youd like to have. It doesnt necessarily cause problems because it doesntusually affect the emotions.Jealousy, on the other hand, permeates the emotions  thus distorting yourability to make decisions and creating the urge to do things that might be self-defeating. In a jealous state, one can feel compelled to do or say things he doesntreally mean; he can become moralistic, hateful of someone he loves, accusing,possessive, vengeful.When youre jealous, its the attention your lover gives to someone else thathurts. The attention may be represented by physical attraction, romantic interest,intellectual stimulation, time spent with the other person, or sexual activity  but Ithink these are all symbols of the attention thats being diverted from you to someoneelse.If some of those things cause jealousy while others dont, its because some ofthem represent to you a higher degree of attention and involvement with thecompetitor.Recognizing JealousyThere are ways to reduce the bad feelings that come from jealousy, and well look atseveral different factors that have a bearing upon it. Well confine our attention tojealousy as it affects romantic relationships; the same principles should apply to anyother type of jealousy.First, its important to emphasize that jealousy is an emotion  an involuntaryresponse to something that happens. Theres no reason to be ashamed of it, to try tosuppress it, or to deny it. When you try to act as if it165doesnt exist, youre in the Intellectual Trap  and youll probably feel worse if youdont get the jealousy out into the open where you can deal with it.If you feel jealous, accept it. That in itself should take some of the sting out of it. Italso helps to be able to tell your lover of your jealousy. If youre afraid to do so, itprobably means that you dont have the best kind of friendship with your lover. If youhave to hide your emotions, youre not free to fully enjoy the relationship.The deepest, most satisfying, most durable relationships are bound to be those inwhich both parties can be totally honest with each other. Without that freedom, youllalways be at least partially in the Identity Trap  unable to express yourself as youreally are, unable to let yourself relax and enjoy what you have.Its also important to your lover that you be honest. He cant be your friend andhelp you if he doesnt know what youre feeling; he cant be as valuable to you as hemight want to be.So honesty is very important. But that means the real truth, not the emotionalwhim you feel at the moment. If the truth is, Im jealous when youre with that person,youre not speaking the truth when you say, You have no right to be with him, orI hate you, or I havent done that; therefore you shouldnt.As always, its in your self-interest to let others be free. There are very few peoplestrong enough to do that  so if youre one of them, you automatically have a head-start on the competition. And the greatest benefits come from a lover whos with youbecause he wants to be with you  because hed rather be with you than with anyoneelse in the world at that moment.Jealousy and restrictions are two different things. One doesnt necessarily followthe other. You can be jealous  openly and honestly  without imposing restrictionsupon your lover.And if youre free to voice your jealousy openly, without condemnation ordemands, you may find that the mere act of saying what you feel will alleviate someof the pain of it. Too often, jealousy smolders and grows because its suppressed ordenied and the discomfort is attributed to something else.No SurprisesJealousy is often caused by surprises. If each of you expects a certain type of conductfrom the other, but you never discuss and define that standard, surprises can result. Ifyou abide by what you think is the standard and then find that your lover hasnt, youcan be hurt and can feel that youve been taken advantage of.166Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldBut its possible that the problem isnt one of misconduct  but rather that noattempt was made to identify what each of you expected from the other.If youre closely involved with someone, define the rules of the relationshipclearly so there can be no misunderstanding. If there are no rules, then that should beopenly expressed and understood also  so that neither party expects from the otherwhat he doesnt intend to give.FidelityThis, of course, brings us to the question of fidelity. You have to decide how freeeach person is to associate with others  especially others who might be romanticrivals. Is it understood that each person may associate with anyone he chooses? Haveother romantic involvements? Have sexual intercourse with others? If not, what are thelimits regarding associations with others?These things must be clearly understood between you. Otherwise, there may besurprises that could pile additional hurt feelings upon already jealous feelings.Be realistic when you decide such things. Dont try to be something youre not;recognize your own emotional nature and self-interest. If you pick a standard determinedby someone else, youll probably have problems. You could easily be tempted tosuppress your emotions when they seem to contradict the standard youve chosen.The rules must be of your own choosing  in keeping with your own natures.Ill offer my observations on the subject, only because they might be helpful to you indefining your own.I think that any restriction is harmful to a good relationship. I want to be free and Iwant those closest to me to be free also. I dont want to be anyones jailer; I dontwant anyone to feel that his life is restricted because of his association with me.That doesnt mean Im never jealous. But Id rather suffer occasional jealousythan to face the problems that restrictions create in a relationship.I realize that life often involves giving up a short-term pleasure for a long-termgain  and restrictions are often justified on that basis. But I want my lover to feel thatshes getting the most possible from me while giving up the least possible.Double StandardsRestrictions often result in a double standard  in which one person is free to dothings that are denied to the other  even if the restrictions werent intended thatway.Freedom from Jealousy Problems167Its possible, for example, that the mans work may involve regular contact withwomen, while his lovers routine might not include contact with other men. If thatsthe case, restrictions upon dates with others will deprive her more than they will him.Hell have the opportunity to meet and associate with other women, possibly evenmeet one more appropriate to him, while shell be confined to her relationship withhim.In other ways, one person is usually affected more than the other by a restriction.Whenever the restriction is lifted, or when the relationship ends, the one mostaffected by the restriction will have suffered for his obedience to it. In effect, hellhave deprived himself until it became in the self-interest of the other person to havethe restriction lifted.In addition, some exceptions are often made to restrictions. Certain outsiders may beconsidered acceptable companions while others are off limits. When that happens, itseasy for one person to feel that the exceptions have favored the other person. In fact,both parties can feel simultaneously that theyre being discriminated against.Im convinced that any relationship will be more open, more honest, and morebenevolent when there are no restrictions. Youll have to decide your rules foryourself, however, and they should be defined in terms of what you believe and whatyoure capable of handling.Natural MonopolyThe answer to the problem of restrictions is to find the relationship in whichtheyre unnecessary. When you find someone who is not only attractive andinteresting, but very appropriate to you in most every way, you wont needrestrictions. Competition will be irrelevant or absent if you find someone who wantsand needs exactly what you are.The urge to restrict stems from a feeling of vulnerability  the fear that someoneelse might offer more of what your lover wants and take attention away from you. Ifthere isnt an overwhelming mutual self-interest between you and your lover, youllcontinue to have that fear  no matter what restrictions are imposed.But if your relationship is the result of mutual understanding, mutual interests,mutual views of the world  in short, if your lover is also your best friend  youwont need restrictions because youll have very little to fear. Youll have a naturalmonopoly upon the attentions of your lover.And one of the ways of creating that is by letting him be free. If he can be freewith you  free to say what he means, free to express his desires and secret feelings(even when they involve attraction to others), free to see whomever he chooses, freeto do as he wants to do  then hell have less need to seek out168Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldothers. Hell be getting from you most everything he needs. Youll be the mostimportant person in his world.The paradox, in a sense, is that hell probably stay closer to home if you dontdemand that he stay home.If you have a natural monopoly, access to others will be valuable to therelationship. For the more your lover associates with others, the more hell be awarethat he gets much more from you than he can get from them. Only by being withothers can he see that clearly.But if you restrict his relationships, the opposite can happen. At a distance, manypeople can appear to be attractive, appropriate  even perfect. All their virtues willbeckon, but none of their drawbacks will be apparent. Thats an undesirable positionfor you to be in; youre being unrealistically compared with an ideal image. Let him goand find that out for himself.Minimizing JealousyEven if its in your self-interest to have your lover associate with others, your emotionsmight not accept the situation so easily.Ones imagination is often his worst enemy when hes jealous; but if usedproperly, your imagination can minimize your emotional discomfort. The trick is toface up to your secret fears so that they no longer terrify you.If your lover is going to spend an evening with someone else, imagine thesituation youre afraid will happen. Imagine the worst. Picture them talking, laughing,kissing, making love  whatever it is you fear will happen. Keep doing it over andover again until it no longer affects you emotionally.This technique has helped me several times. It neutralizes my fears, but neverseems to eliminate the good emotions I feel toward someone.I remember using it once when I was involved with a woman with whom I didnthave too much in common. The inappropriateness of the relationship made me feelquite vulnerable.One night I had to give a lecture and she announced that she was going out withsomeone else. I was sure theyd wind up in bed  and it infuriated me. I didnt wantto stop her but I still felt terribly jealous.On the way to the lecture, I stopped for dinner. For the previous three hours, Id beenunable to think of anything but the terrible thing I was sure was going to happen. I finallydecided that I wouldnt be able to give the lecture unless I calmed down.After ordering my dinner, I started to use the technique. I had never seen the otherman involved  which always seems to make such a person more formidable. So Ipictured him as the exact opposite of me, the kind of man IFreedom from Jealousy Problems169wouldnt like, the kind of man who could sweet-talk women away from their lovers. Iimagined them doing together every obscene thing I could think of.21I was determined to keep thinking about the scene over and over again until it nolonger bothered me emotionally. However, I suddenly realized that I was thinkingabout the lecture I was going to give; I hadnt made it all the way through theimaginary sex scene even once. So I turned my mind back to the horrible scene andconcentrated on it again.But it quickly became apparent that my mind had wandered once again. And then itdawned on me that the scene no longer held any terror for me  not even any interest,in fact.So I spent the rest of my dinner time planning my lecture and never gave the jealousyproblem another thought. In all, it had taken only about five minutes of attention toeliminate all the pain and fear.Of course, it doesnt always work out so easily. But if youll give the technique atry, I think youll find it can minimize jealous pangs when your lover is going to be withsomeone else.The Right SituationFind the person whos most appropriate for you and youll probably discover thatjealousy is much less of a problem.Examine yourself, find out what you have to offer, determine what kind of personcould make you most happy. And then find that person. If youre honest with yourselfand then find the person most appropriate to you, chances are that person will feel thesame way about you. Youll have a natural monopoly.In that situation, youll know that just being what you are is earning for you whatyou want  and youll know that it will be highly unlikely that a third party can comebetween you.That doesnt mean you should never become involved with someone whos lessthan perfect for you. Its easy to become infatuated with someone for purelysuperficial reasons. Theres no reason to ignore that or to attempt to deny yourfeelings in such a situation.Accept your infatuation and enjoy it. You might even find that the situation willlead to more than youd expected. But dont count on your feelings (or his) remainingas they are indefinitely. Be prepared for the possibility that one of you may soon meetsomeone else more appropriate  or even that the infatuation will just fade away.170Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World21In this context, obscene means all the sexual things I like to do  when done bysomeone else.Enjoy such relationships but dont let them keep you from watching for theperson with whom you could have a better relationship. Go to the places where youdbe most likely to meet such a person; display yourself as you are at all times. That willincrease your chances of meeting the person who can mean the most to you.That person will want you just as you are. Hell understand and appreciate whatyou are. Hell understand your thoughts and feelings and respect you for being honestabout them.Youll have found the person who can be both your lover and your best friend.And every benefit that comes from having a friend or a lover will be magnified manytimes over because theyre combined in one person.With him, youll have far less reason to feel jealous. Youll have the naturalsecurity that comes from knowing youve earned honestly what you have and that itsunlikely anyone could replace you.That doesnt mean youll never be jealous. But youll be able to deal with itopenly and honestly with your lover  because hell also be your best friend.He wont sacrifice for you; its not in your self-interest that he do so. But hellunderstand how you feel and make it much easier for you. Together, youll be able towork out problems because youll have a common viewpoint toward such situations.Youll be able to discuss problems rather than argue about them.And you should feel a great sense of self-esteem when you know that your loverwants you more than anyone else in the world. He genuinely wants you  notbecause youve limited his alternatives, but because hes seen the competition and heprefers you.Freedom from Jealousy Problems171Love sought is good, but givn unsought is better. Shakespeare21Freedom from Family ProblemsMany people might respond to the idea of a non-marriage as something excellent but of course impossible if you have children, in-laws, or relatives.Having children doesnt have to interfere with the love relationship. In fact, thereare many reasons the non-marriage framework provides a better setting than marriagefor raising children. There are fewer complications, and the relationships betweeneveryone involved can be more easily understood.Once again, its necessary to try to set aside the normal ways of thinking aboutthese questions. The normal ways dont often work  and usually because thesovereignty of each individual isnt respected.The raising of children is a far-reaching subject, and I wouldnt presume toanswer all the questions involved within a few pages. But I think there are basicguidelines that can provide a harmonious framework within which children can growto be clear-thinking individuals.One of the values of the non-marriage arrangement is that it keeps all things on anindividualized basis and precludes the need for group decisions. All property anddecisions are controlled by one person or another  not by both.Though a child is not a thing to be owned, some of the same principles apply todecision-making and custody that apply to property. Someone must make decisionsconcerning the child; and if theres a separation, the question of custody will arise.One of the most difficult problems a child can face is in being subject toconflicting authorities when the parents disagree. Hes put in an unfortunate positionwhen two people whom he loves are claiming authority and telling him to act in twodifferent ways. He knows he has to disappoint one of them when there aredisagreements.How much simpler for everyone concerned if one person has the majorresponsibility and sets the main plans for the childs upbringing.If the parents differences of opinion are so great that one couldnt stand to livewith a child raised by the other, they probably shouldnt have a child  no matterwhat the arrangement. But if theyre compatible enough to live together172harmoniously, the chances are good that one will not object to the methods used bythe person who has the main responsibility.CustodyI think its important, then, that it be clearly established before the child is bornwhich parent will be the principal custodian of the child. That parent will have thefinal say in decisions concerning the child and will automatically have custody of thechild if the parents should separate.If you think ahead to such a decision, you can see that the woman will ultimatelycontrol such a question of custody. She has to deliver the child, and she doesnt have toget pregnant if she doesnt want to. Also, she can leave any time during the pregnancy andtake the unborn child with her. So she will be the ultimate custodian unless she agreesotherwise.Any agreement made before the birth can be altered later if both parties agree. Infact, if after the child is old enough to have some conception of the consequences ofhis choice he chooses the non-custodial parent (and that parent agrees), its probablybest for all concerned that his choice be honored in the event of a separation of theparents.Before the child is conceived, the ultimate custodian should consider whether hesprepared to support and raise the child with or without the other parent. Its foolishto ignore the possibility that you may be on your own again someday.If youre to be the custodian, ask yourself if youll be able to raise and supportthat child by yourself. If youre not sure, you ought to be doubly cautious about having achild.If youre a woman, you might assume that the law will make your husbandresponsible to support the child after a separation  but such assumptions aredangerous. The world is full of divorced women with children who are tryingdesperately to get their ex-husbands to fulfill their obligations.And if you expect that you might have to depend upon the law to enforce yourrelationship with your husband, then your entire relationship is probablymisconceived. Why would you want to live with, and raise a family with, a man whomust be forced to do what you think is right?I favor the idea that it should be agreed from the beginning that the custodian willbe totally responsible for the child in the event of a separation. That merelyrecognizes what may be the case anyway. And if it develops that both parties wantcustody, it wont turn out that one will get custody and the other the bills.Freedom from Family Problems173If a woman agrees to assume custody of a child, that encourages her to maintainher income-producing ability throughout the relationship  instead of becomingfinancially dependent upon her husband and thus less free.If the woman doesnt think she could handle such financial responsibility, but bothparties want to have a child, the man can establish a monetary fund before the birth ofthe child. The fund can provide the financial means for the woman to be solelyresponsible for the child if it ever becomes necessary. That will eliminate the sense ofdependence that might otherwise cause her to remain in an unrewarding relationship.All these matters are subjective decisions to be made by you and your lover. Butits important that the decisions be made  in advance of the time that they might benecessary.Raising the ChildAs early as possible, its valuable to establish relationships with your child that aresimilar to the relationship you have with your lover.The child should have his own world where he is clearly the sovereign. That means aroom of his own that is subject to his control alone. If he doesnt take care of it, helllearn the consequences of that sooner or later. But if hes forced to keep it as hisparents wish, hell never discover for himself the consequences of alternative coursesof action.He should also have other property to use in whatever way he chooses. Propertyisnt owned if it can be used only in approved ways.Youll have to decide how hell obtain his property. He can earn it, receive anallowance, get outright gifts, or he can receive property in any combination of these ways.But once he receives something, its important that he learn to understand what itmeans to own something and be responsible for its preservation. He shouldnt betaught to expect automatic replacement of any property he might destroy.The importance of his sense of ownership can be seen by observing the difficultiesmany adults have in dealing with the world. For close to two decades, most people are ledto believe that they arent sovereign.Then, suddenly, theyre thrust out into the world and expected to make far-reaching decisions concerning their lives. Its no wonder that they have difficultyforeseeing the consequences of their actions and fall back on any authority thatappears to be competent to make decisions for them.I believe the child will be far better equipped to face the world if he understandshow the world operates right from the beginning. He can easily174Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldlearn what it means to make decisions and to experience the consequences of hisdecisions.This means, too, that he should be helped to understand that you have yourproperty, also. Show him which areas are off limits to him or require permissionbefore he can use them.Obviously, a two-year-old child wont have an explicit understanding of thesematters. But there are two ways that he can understand them at the earliest possibleage. One is that he can learn by example if the entire family operates in this way.The second way is by never being taught otherwise. For some reason, manyparents seem to think it important to change systems at some point in a childs age.They first teach him he has no authority over his life, and then try later to instill asense of responsibility in him. In the same way, they first want him to believe thatSanta Claus loves and rewards him and then later want him to understand that its theparents who love him. I think it would make a considerable difference if the child werenever taught anything that you intend to reverse later.Its important that each of the three of you be a separate human being with hisown life, his own interests, and his own property. None of you is living for the benefitof the others; rather, each should be there because he wants to be. And each will wantto be there if its a setting where he can live a meaningful life of his own choosing.A Sovereign ChildIf you want your child to understand that he lives in a world in which his futurewill be of his own making, encourage that by letting him deal directly with the world asmuch as possible. Let him experience the consequences of his own actions.Naturally, you dont intend to let him discover first hand a very dangerousconsequence of something he wants to do. But its important to decide in advancewhere you will draw the line. How far will you let him go in making his owndecisions? Dont leave it to decide each time the matter arises. Have a clearly definedpolicy in advance; that will prevent inconsistencies.Be available to let him know your opinions  without implying that youropinions are binding on him. Let him think of you as a wiser, more experiencedperson  but not as a moral authority who stands in the way of his living his ownlife.Be a source of information and opinion concerning the consequences of acts. Lethim learn that the nature of the world he lives in (not the attitudes ofFreedom from Family Problems175people bigger and smarter than he is) sets the limits on what he can and cannot do inthe world.If you recognize him as an individual who is allowed to learn for himself, agenuine friendship can develop between you. Hell be willing to talk to you about hisideas, plans, and problems  because he wont have to fear the moral retribution thatmost parents inflict when they disagree with their childrens ideas and actions.Parents who fear letting their children make decisions fail to realize that theirchildren do make decisions on their own. You cant possibly control all your childsactions. So the best security you can have comes from two conditions: (1) allowingthe child to learn as early as possible that his actions have consequences to him; and(2) developing a friendship that will make it possible for him to come to you when heneeds help.If either of those conditions is missing, you shouldnt be surprised if you find outabout crises only after theyve happened. A child who knows that acts haveconsequences and who knows that he has a wise friend will be more likely to consulthis friend before risking something dangerous.Love and understanding are important to a child. And youll show your love moreby respecting his individuality and appreciating him for what he is, not for what youforce him to be.Think It over FirstIts unfortunate that its almost impossible to learn second hand what it means tohave children. As a result, parents learn only after the fact the responsibilities theyhave assumed by bringing a child into the world. If it were somehow possible to learnbeforehand, there might be fewer unhappy parents and disturbed children.Ive observed many situations in which people conceived children without any realnotion of the responsibilities they were taking on. Often, its an example of the EmotionalTrap, in which the desire for a child is taken out of the context of the consequencesinvolved.Its true that you can put a child out for adoption if you cant get along with him,but few parents are willing to do that, no matter what the problem. So youre usuallyassuming eighteen or more years of responsibility. And no matter how much you maycherish the child, it will place restrictions on your own actions.Its usually assumed by parents that if they do all the right things, the child willcause very few problems for them. And Im convinced that a recognition of theprinciples covered already in this chapter can eliminate many of the normaldifficulties.176Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldBut the fact is that its a human being youre bringing into the world, not a robotthat needs only to be programmed correctly. The influences that come from school andneighborhood, as well as from yourself, are not totally within your control.You cant realistically approach child-raising unless youre willing to accept that thechild will have his own nature, no matter how you might raise him.So, in effect, youre inviting a stranger to live in your home for eighteen years ormore. There are risks involved  plenty of them. Youre committing a large part ofyour future to satisfy a desire that may be only a part of the present.In other words, Im suggesting that you be very careful in making a decisionconcerning the conception of a child. If you have a truly loving relationship with yourspouse, there will probably be less desire (and less feeling of need) to amend therelationship by adding a child. And if you dont have an excellent relationship withyour spouse, bringing a child into it will probably worsen the situation, not better it.I think that the worst time to have a child is when the parents are in theirtwenties. Theyve hardly had time to understand themselves and decide in any durableway what they want from their lives. Their plans and ideas may change many timesbefore the child would be even ten years old.Theres nothing disastrous about having a child when the parents are in their thirties.A child born to such parents is more likely to be treated with greater consistency, withmore love, and with more perspective than one born to younger parents.My parents were both around forty when I was born and I can see manyadvantages that I gained from that. They were much more ready to devote themselvesto children; their basic plans and life styles had been clearly established and neverchanged while I was growing up. When they ran into financial difficulties later, theytreated such matters with a realistic perspective, and I never had any reason to feelthat I was somehow responsible for their difficulties.If you like children, there are ways to enjoy them without becoming a parent. Youcan be a YMCA counselor, den mother, school helper, or Boy Scout leader limiting your exposure to children to the ways you desire.When you become a parent, however, youre bringing a stranger into the worldwith the requirement that you get along with him  no matter who he is.Existing ChildrenIf you already have children and the suggestions made earlier make sense to you,they can be implemented, no matter how old your child is already.Freedom from Family Problems177Naturally, the earlier you start, the easier and more effective the methods shouldbe. But theres no reason to refrain from taking a course of action you deem right, nomatter how long you may have been doing things another way.Its important to realize, however, that your child may not understand the valueof the change as well as you do. For instance, the prospect of making his owndecisions could be frightening if hes used to being given orders.I suggest that the changeover be gradual, with the speed dictated by how well thechild understands what is happening and can recognize the benefits to himself.If you have a teenage child with whom you havent cultivated a friendship, dontexpect to make friends quickly. And dont tell him youre now going to be his friend just do it.Take it slow, be patient, and prove your friendship by actions, not by declarationsof intent. Take any opportunity that arises to try to understand his thinking without exercising your moral judgment. His thoughts and actions are his  whetheror not you approve  so you wont accomplish anything by condemning what hedoes.When he decides that you are capable of understanding his thoughts and motives,he may begin asking your opinions. Even then, take it slowly. Point out what youbelieve to be the likely consequences of various actions, but let him know that itsyour opinion and acknowledge that he may not see it the same way.The establishment of independent property can be handled in the same gradualway, no matter what the age of the child. Let his understanding and acceptance dictatethe speed of the changeover.Non-InterferenceThe principles of individuality discussed in this chapter can help considerably tocreate a rewarding relationship with your children, rather than the series of conflictsand crises that so many parents take for granted.Your own individuality and your relationship with your lover can be preservedmore easily this way, too. For a child who recognizes his own sovereignty and thesovereignty of others will understand the importance of your having your own life andyour own relationships with others.Jealousy among members of the family will be less likely if each personunderstands that there are separate relationships between each of the people involved and that each relationship is of a different kind.178Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldYou and your lover will be free to develop your own interests and to do thethings that will add to your love. And as the years pass, youll spend less of your timeworrying that your children might be getting into trouble.Treat your child as a human being  not as a household pet to be taught tricks. Ifyou do, its unlikely that hell prevent you from having a life of your own and asatisfying relationship with your lover.Those RelativesAnother family area that creates restrictions upon ones life is the existence ofrelatives.There appears to be an unwritten law that blood is thicker than self-interest. Onesupposedly has a duty to value his blood relatives  simply because theyre relatives.This means, for openers, that you owe something to your parents. And then youhave a multitude of responsibilities to anyone else who happens to be in the familytree by accident of birth.If your cousin has a heart attack, you might be expected to chip in for the hospitalbill. Or if your uncle lives in the same city as you do, you might be expected to curtailsome of your own activities so as not to embarrass the family.Or if your child chooses to have ten children of his own, youre expected to buyten birthday presents and ten Christmas gifts every year for the grandchildren. Andyou might even be called upon to take care of some of the grandchildren if the loadbecomes too great.Since my family has never imposed these kinds of burdens upon me, it was only afew years ago that I became aware that this sort of thing was so widespread. At first,I was amazed to discover how much of an individuals life could be monopolized byhis relatives.To be responsible for someone who happens to have been born into the samefamily doesnt make sense. Any relationship that isnt based upon mutual self-interestis bound to have poor consequences.Your ParentsThe most serious problems usually develop with ones parents.My friend Marian Hall Landers once pointed out that, too often, a parentchildrelationship is a unilateral contract, initiated and ruled by the parents. They decide notonly what they will give to the child but also what the child owes them in return.Freedom from Family Problems179The parents seldom even state precisely what this is. They can simply invoke a claim atany time for anything, justified by all weve done for you.The parents might claim money, attention, time, love, or favors; or they mightdemand that the child live his life in a way approved by them.As a result, the child can carry a vague, indefinite and  for all practical purposes infinite debt. Hes never wholly free to plan his own future without potentialinterference from his parents.This, of course, takes us back to the Identity Trap, the Morality Trap, and theUnselfishness Trap. All kinds of pressures are used to enforce the parents claims; butmore than anything else, the weapon used is guilt. The child is made to feel guilty fordisappointing the parents.It may be redundant to point out once again that no one is qualified to run yourlife for you, but the point cant be made too often.Whatever your parents did for you was actually what they did for themselves.They took a calculated risk that the time, effort, and money they expended wouldproduce the kind of child they wanted, a child they would enjoy  and they hoped theirefforts would lead you to a life they would consider favorable to them. If you choosenot to live that kind of life, they lose on that part of their investment.Your parents decided for themselves how they would live their own lives. Theymay have chosen to do what their parents wanted, or they may have chosen to gotheir own ways. They may have accepted the authority of the church or thegovernment or someone else.Whatever they did, they chose to do it. They may have chosen wisely or they mayhave chosen foolishly  but they chose.Now you have to choose, too. And you have to choose in a way that fits your nature.Thats the only way you have of achieving a satisfying life for yourself. If your parentsprefer that you be an obedient but unhappy child, then they can hardly be considerednecessary or valuable friends.They may never understand that you have to choose for yourself. If you base yourhopes upon getting their agreement before you act in ways of your choosing, yourerelying on an indirect alternative  and you may wait the rest of your life without everacquiring the opportunity to be free.If you choose for yourself, youll undoubtedly make mistakes along the way. Butyoud have made mistakes, too, if youd followed your parents advice. And the mistakesyou make on your own will teach you far more than the mistakes made followinganothers rules.180Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldHandling GuiltWhether your restrictions are imposed by your parents or other relatives, theirprincipal weapon is most likely guilt. They can make you suffer emotional discomfortfor going your own way  even if youre convinced youre right.Because guilt is an emotion, theres no easy way to eliminate it. But it helps torealize that once the guilt is inflicted upon you, theres usually never enough you cando for your relatives to get rid of the guilt. Youre going to feel guilty even if you domost of whats asked of you.If thats the case, you might as well go ahead and enjoy your life as you want to. Ifyoure going to feel guilty anyway, you might as well have a good time while youredoing it.And you might be amazed at how quickly the negative feelings can be alleviatedby the rewards of your independence  and even just by the feeling of independence.If youre going to do something that your family will disapprove of, and youexpect to feel guilty about it, try using the technique suggested in the Box-Trapchapter.Take a few minutes to be by yourself. Relax and imagine the experience that youregoing to go through. Picture what you will do, and imagine the reactions youllreceive from those youre concerned about.It may be a painful experience. If so, go through it again  and again  until itsno longer painful for you. In effect, youre desensitizing your emotions in advance, sothat youll be less likely to get the guilty emotional reaction when you actually gothrough the experience.Picture the very worst that you can imagine might happen as a result of yourplanned action. Be prepared for very bad reactions from others. Youll be less likelythen to be thrown off balance by surprises.In this way, you might be able to reduce the emotional pressure.In addition, the emotional difficulties will probably lessen if you have less contactwith those who are imposing the guilt upon you. Theres no point in exposingyourself to someone with whom you have a primarily negative relationship.If you rely upon your parents for financial support, you have to decide which is moreimportant to you  the money or your independence and emotional relaxation.Whichever way you decide, it will help to recognize that you have made a choice;whatever difficulties ensue can then be understood as the price youre paying for whatyou want.Freedom from Family Problems181Getting FreeIf you feel imprisoned by your parents or relatives, it is you who must make themove to be free. No one else is going to bestow your freedom upon you.In any kind of disengagement, you dont have to be brutal, indignant, resentful, orunfeeling. You have only to decide carefully what you believe the limits of yourinvolvement should be, and then set about to make that a reality. Recognize that everyoneinvolved is doing what he thinks best, that it is a conflict of interest that creates theproblem.Dont overreact to a difficult relationship by destroying the good parts while trying toweed out the bad. Emphasize the good parts in discussions with the others. But make itclear that you wont participate any longer in the bad parts.If you continue to show respect and affection while living your own life, thedecision will then be up to them. If theyre hostile, thats their decision, not yours. Thebreak will have come from them, not from you. Naturally, you should prepare yourselfemotionally for such a possibility.Its your ChoiceA discussion of the possible problems one can face with relatives could go onendlessly. But whatever the problem, the principles discussed in this book apply, andespecially those concerning relationships.You are an individual, not part of a group. Your relationship with anyone shouldbe confined to those areas that are mutually beneficial. And no relationship should havea lifetime contract implied in it.You will decide for yourself what youll do with your life. You can choose theindirect alternative of trying to please others by your actions. Or you can choose thedirect alternatives and live your life as you want to live it.No one is holding you back. Those who want to restrict you have no power overyou; they rely upon your willingness to stay in the traps. All you have to do is toreject the traps and climb out of the boxes. Its entirely your decision to make.Because of common backgrounds, and often common interests, families can be agreat source of pleasure. If you remove the boxes, debts, and obligations from therelationships, you may find that a new and valuable framework is available in whichyou can deal with your relatives on a mutually rewarding basis.If that happens, they may come to see the benefit to themselves in what youvedone. They may appreciate the fact that you care for them because of what they are,instead of respecting them only because they happen to be relatives.182Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThat consequence isnt guaranteed. But no matter what happens, it cant beworse than giving up your life to try to pay an unending debt.Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, wbo havent got theremotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about whento die.Freedom from Family Problems183 Oscar Wilde22Freedom from Business ProblemsRelationships with business associates frequently become boxes. The traditionalways of structuring business enterprises lead easily to restrictions, bad feelings, andconflicts of interest between employers, employees, and partners.Suppose, for example, that you and a friend discover that you have certaincomplementary talents and see a market for those talents. You might decide to gointo business by setting up a partnership or corporation in which youll share 50/50.Youd probably agree that youll both work hard and split whatever profits comefrom the business.Youve already made your first mistakes.As we saw in Chapter 6, partnerships are a form of the Group Trap. Theydiscourage incentive and create problems by ignoring the principles of goodrelationships we covered in Chapter 18.The partnership isnt a living entity with a single purpose and a single mind.Each of you will remain individuals  with individual motives, talents, goals, andattitudes. So your ideas about the business will differ in some ways.For instance, you may each agree to work hard, but the word hard defiesprecise definition. What you each mean by your intentions probably wont bemutually understood until you have a disagreement and one of you thinks the otherisnt working hard enough.Even if you work equally hard, you wont produce the exact same value. So theone whos more valuable will be subsidizing the other to some extent. In fact, each ofyou could come to think that hes the stronger partner and that the other is therebygetting a better deal.Often, a partnership is established to combine two different talents  one may bethe producer and the other the seller. Both functions are essential to the business, butthey wont necessarily be equal in value. So to share 50/50 (or by any other ratio) canopen the door to resentments.As we saw in the Group-Trap chapter, if your reward is dependent upon morethan your own output, you wont have a 100% incentive to produce more. Foranything you do, youll receive only half the reward  the other half going to yourpartner. As a result, there will be a natural incentive to produce less and to encourageyour partner to produce more.184Dozens of other problems are inherent in partnerships, but we dont need todetail them here. If youve ever been in one, you probably know them all. You mayfeel that you made a bad choice of partners, but its more likely that you made a badchoice of structures.Action involves thinking, deciding, valuing, and doing  by one human being. Iftwo people intend to act together, each will still think, decide, evaluate, and do so inhis own way  in accordance with his own nature. As in any other type ofrelationship, its important that neither be dependent upon another persons way ofdoing things. Each person should control and evaluate his own actions in terms of thepersonal consequences to himself.And he should have the opportunity to achieve his objectives by dealing at anytime with anyone who offers him a way to fulfill those objectives, without having todeal with anyone whose objectives or methods are in conflict with his.Unfortunately, the normal ways of operating a business overlook these principles.They amalgamate individuals into groups and hope for collective action. Theybroaden business relationships beyond the common interests that are required to fulfillones objectives. And they attempt to achieve success and longevity through contractsthat transcend the individuals self-interest.Since most businesses violate the basic principles of good relationships, mostbusinessmen are entangled in many restrictions that arent necessary. The normal waysrequire a great deal of supervision that shouldnt be necessary. And the employees of thebusiness have greater restrictions upon their time than is necessary.If a relationship is structured so that each person has his own area ofresponsibility over which he has complete control, most of the typical headaches ofbusiness can be eliminated.A Better WayThis should be clearer as we apply these principles to a business enterprise.Suppose you have an idea for a product or service you think would succeed inthe market. You wont have the talents or time necessary to do everything in thebusiness, but that doesnt mean you have to take on a partner, nor even that you needemployees.For instance, youre not going to construct your own typewriter, mill your ownstationery, nor operate your own telephone company. Other people will do thosethings; but you wouldnt think of taking them into your business as partners  norwould you hire them as employees to be paid on an hourly or weekly basis. Youllcontract with them  but only for what you need from them.Freedom from Business Problems185Why cant you contract for any service you need?You may not even know how to produce the product you want to market. Ifthats the case, find someone who can produce it  but dont make him your partner.Find out how much hell charge you to manufacture the product for you.Then check with other potential manufacturers to determine your alternatives. Pickthe one that offers you the most of what you want.You can check the marketplace at any time to see if youre getting the bestpossible deal from your supplier  but you cant do that with a partner.You can acquire any service you need in the same way. Perhaps you dont evenknow how to operate a business. Find someone who does. Then find someone elsewho does, and perhaps even someone else. See what each has to offer and at whatprice.Select the best one to run the business for you and pay him on a basis that makeshis income an incentive to provide exactly what you want. Define what it is you wantfrom him  and pay him as he provides that.In the same way, you can contract for every service necessary to make thebusiness work. You dont have to acquire partners or employees. You simply contractwith people to provide whatever you need.If you need a salesman for your product, find one and pay him on the basis of howmuch he sells. Dont pay him for the time he spends in the office; compensate him onthe basis of sales.If you need a bookkeeper, what you want from him is usable informationregarding your financial status. Determine what information you need and pay him forthe information, not for his time  which might include coffee breaks, trips to therestroom, and flirting with the receptionist. Pay him for what you want to receive andlet him determine how much time he needs to do the job.When you pay for results, not for time, you get three important benefits: (1) youhave an accurate understanding of what each thing costs you (and can easily comparealternatives); (2) you no longer have to supervise the individuals time  all you haveto do is check his results; and (3) each supplier has the same incentive you do withregard to his service  hell profit most by doing what is most valuable to you.Its important, too, that you dont try to create group incentives. Dont offer topay someone on the basis of the net profits of the business. He doesnt control theamount of net profit by his one service, so he has little incentive to try to increase it.The only exception might be a manager hired to run the business. He would be ina position to affect the profits  and so you might decide to pay him on that basis.186Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldSometimes adjustments are necessary as you go along. You might make acontract with someone to have him provide a specific result for you. But thecompensation might not be directed in such a way that his greatest incentive is to providethe result you want. If so, you may have to make adjustments until his incentive isexactly the same as yours.At that point, hell apply his creative talents to discover ways of doing the jobmore efficiently. Very few people are stupid; its just that most employees have noreal incentive to use their intelligence in their jobs. So they reserve their mentalenergy for their hobbies, personal relationships, and other things outside the office. Infact, with normal compensation systems, an employee often uses most of his initiativefiguring out how to work less without losing his job.With the right system, that mental energy can be unleashed on your behalf.Another benefit of this system is that it allows you to begin with much lesscapital  and thus, with less risk. You pay for things only as you need them; theresno weekly payroll that must be met regardless of the need for it; as a result, you needfewer permanent facilities.Even if you dont have enough money to begin, you can pay interest onborrowed money; you dont have to take in a partner. Arrangements whereby aninvestor is made a partner are risky; if the business is a success, youll be sharing yourprofits long after you need the initial capital. While thats a decision you mightwillingly make, you may regret it five years later. And taking in a partner always opensthe door to joint decisions and disagreements.Whatever you need  services, money, advice  you can usually pay for on asingle-exchange basis.Your Own SystemObviously, this system could raise enough questions to fill a book by itself.Theres a whole science involved in business compensation systems. But you can probablywork out a very effective one for yourself if you keep the three basic principles inmind:1. Deal with each individual on an individual basis. Make sure his compensation isdependent only upon his own value to you.2. Contract only for what you want. Determine what results you wantfrom someone and pay for those results only. If he delivers, youneednt worry about how he uses his time  thats not your concern.3. Dont attempt to perpetuate a relationship by contract. If anycontracts are necessary, make them for the shortest practical periodof time, with ways of terminating with relatively shortFreedom from Business Problems187notice. Try to avoid any situation in which you or anyone else isobligated to perform services beyond the time in which its in hisself-interest to do so. You wont get good value when the individualno longer wants to be involved.Ive seen a number of businesses operated profitably in this way. The owners ofthose businesses avoid the normal problems that most businessmen take for granted.Employees (suppliers) are more devoted to their work, very little supervision isrequired, costs are always clearly discernible and the lowest available commensuratewith quality.I mentioned in Chapter 16 that I had avoided payroll taxes by transformingemployees into independent contractors. That was only one of the benefits. Thebusiness had been losing money so fast it was about to go under.After eliminating all employees (including myself) and contracting for services needed,the business was in the black. Those who continued to work with me made more moneyper hour worked, and I was able to cut my working time by about half. Nothing elsechanged but the system of compensation  and that one change provided manybenefits.Even if you dont operate a business, youre in a better position if you act as asupplier of a service rather than as an employee. You can contract with companies toperform specific services for them at specific prices. In addition to the tax benefits,you can choose your own working hours, usually make more money, and have morefree time.If you avoid the assumptions that most employers and employees take forgranted, you can earn the money you want without sacrificing your freedom to get it.Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

They hope that someone outsidethemselves can guarantee security and end their need to be concerned about it. But allthey do is make themselves more vulnerable, and hence more insecure, by becomingdependent upon someone else.Security comes from your ability to deal with the world, not from a guarantee bysomeone else. When you know youre capable of dealing with whatever comes, you havethe only security the world has to offer.And your ability to deal with the world depends upon three assets: selfreliance,vigilance, and honesty with yourself.To be self-reliant is to recognize that no one else is as concerned about yourfuture as you are and that no one knows as much about you as you do. You candelegate decisions to others, but a secure individual recognizes that hes taking a riskwhen he does so. He knows that the responsibility for anything concerning his liferemains with himself  and he accepts that responsibility.To be vigilant is to recognize that there will be constant change in the world. Thereare always unknown factors that can affect your plans. So the secure individual isalways mentally prepared for changes and surprises. He doesnt necessarily have aplan in mind to handle those changes and surprises, but hes aware that they canhappen and is prepared to deal with them as they arise.To be honest with yourself means to acknowledge mistakes as they becomeknown. If you can accept your mistakes, you can correct them, pay for them, learnfrom them, and see that they dont interfere with your security. The individual whocant acknowledge his mistakes will remain vulnerable and be doomed to repeatthem.190If you have these assets, you have no reason to be afraid; youll know you canhave love and financial security, and you wont need anyone to tell you that youreright.Lets look at each of the three forms of security to see how these principles work.Financial SecurityAll financial dealings depend upon the reaction of the General Market. Whetheryour assets are in cash, investments, skills, or property, the worth of them will dependupon market acceptance.As tastes and values change, the General Market changes. Stocks go up anddown, currencies rise and fall, property changes in value.Many people thought theyd found security in the 1920s by putting their money inthe stock market, or by having it handled by a bank. They felt that their interests werebeing protected by people more capable than themselves. They were proven wrong in1929, and they paid for their willingness to rely upon others.Naturally, its helpful to utilize the information provided by people who specializein various fields and to use the services they offer. But its a mistake to think that thosepeople know everything necessary, or that they will always act in your best interests.In the same way, its foolish to believe the government can protect or guaranteeyour future. Governments are subject to the same laws of economics as anyone else.The only security they offer is the promise to take care of you with other peoplesmoney. But what if those other people dont produce enough to take care of everyonewho is relying upon the government?Many people have faith that the government can somehow overrule the laws ofeconomics, or that the government can use more resources than actually exist. Sothey trust the claims that their bank deposits are insured, that medical care will alwaysbe available to them, that Social Security will eliminate the need to provide for theirfutures. But the government has no power to transform stones into bread; and iftheres another great depression (as I think there will be), this will become all tooevident.This doesnt mean you have to spend all your time watching your money. Itmeans only that you must allow for many different possibilities. Diversification,periodic monitoring, and the willingness to acknowledge mistakes are the necessaryingredients of a secure future.For example, Swiss banks in general are more realistic and more conservative,and so are safer depositories for savings than American banks. ButFreedom from Insecurity191the alert individual will increase the odds for safety by using two or more Swiss banksso as not to be vulnerable to any one of them.Security doesnt require absolute knowledge of the future. Its simply the recognitionthat changes will take place and the knowledge that youre willing to deal with whateverhappens.Youll have that attitude if youre willing to rely upon yourself, recognize thestate of constant change, and be willing to acknowledge any mistakes you make alongthe way.Financial insecurity is inherent in any situation where youre relying uponsomeone outside your control. Then youre vulnerable  he has to be right  andyoull naturally worry that things may not work out as you want them to.IncomeThe same principles apply to your ability to acquire income in the future. No one cantake the gamble out of life for you, no matter how much he may promise to do so. Butwhen you recognize that you have the power to deal with anything that lies ahead, anuncertain future can be a source of adventure rather than a fearful liability.I havent the faintest idea what Ill be doing five years from now. I may be writingbooks; I may be doing something else that I cant even conceive of now. I dont knowwhere Ill be living. I know only one thing  that life will continue to be as exciting andas full of happy surprises as it is now.My life is an adventure because Im not vulnerable to someone elses mistakes.Im not depending upon someone to guarantee my income  someone who could fail.If I fail, it will be a simple matter to pay for my mistakes and move right on to betterthings. If I were to stake my future on someone elses ability, Id be constantly afraidthat he might not do the right things  afraid that he might make a bad mistake butwouldnt have the honesty to acknowledge and correct it.If a factory closes, most of the people who worked there will sulk over theirmisfortune. They had depended upon the continuation of that one source of income.They were vulnerable because they couldnt conceive of any other possibilities.Meanwhile, a free person will move on to something better. He may have no newalternatives in mind at the time of the closing, but he knows that other alternativesexist  and that he can always find a way of being valuable to someone in exchangefor money.Hes prepared for such a possibility, because he never believes that any situationhas to be permanent. Hes ready for change whenever it might happen.192Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldNo one can guarantee a steady pay check for you. Anyone who promises to doso is simply being unrealistic.Your income will always depend upon the changing values of the GeneralMarket. You cant expect to receive money unless youre providing a service tosomeone whos willing to pay for it. That applies whether you perform services ormake investments.If you realize that there will always be people willing to pay to have things done,and if youre willing to find out what theyre willing to pay for, you have nothing tobe afraid of. Youll know that you can always strike a bargain with someone to dosomething  even if youre flat on your back.You may decide to have the managers of a company provide a market for yourservices, but dont assume it must be permanent. For if you do, youll be insecure.They can be wrong; they can fail; they can lose interest in their work. But youll neverlose interest in yourself or your own future  so why not depend upon you?Intellectual SecurityFor the past 22 chapters Ive been saying that you are sovereign. Youre theabsolute final judge of the worth of information you receive; youre the one whodecides every one of your actions; youre the person who determines what is rightand wrong for you.Thats the simple reality of it. But many people dont want that responsibility  eventhough they cant possibly discard it. And so they hope to be handed a ready-madephilosophy of life. Such a person wants someone else to guarantee that hes right no matter what happens.You are responsible, because you will experience the consequences of your ownacts, and those consequences are the final judge of whether youve been right orwrong. They provide a verdict from which there is no appeal.The insecure individual hopes somehow to bypass that verdict. He looks for away to believe hes right, no matter what consequences he experiences.He looks for a source of truth that he can believe in. When he finds it, heaccepts it totally. He feels that this gives him the security to know that hes right, and heprefers that kind of security to the need to rely upon his own ability.The philosophy be finds usually contains three basic ingredients. They are moralrightness, a leader, and an enemy. These ingredients arm him with an assurance thatallows him to disregard the test of consequences.The sense of moral rightness permits him to believe that hes right no matter whatthe consequences he receives in life. He settles for whatever happiness heFreedom from Insecurity193gains from knowing hes adhered strictly to the code. He knows he was right inwhat he did  righter than his successful, wealthy, peaceful, joyous neighbor.Such a philosophy will usually have a leader to give the individual the confidencethat he doesnt have in himself. If questions or doubts arise, the leader can set them torest. The insecure individual may feel, I cant tell what is right, but he says its right and he must know.It always seems necessary, too, for the philosophy to have an enemy. Thatprovides a ready-made explanation for any bad consequences that may occur.Since the philosophy is usually expressed in terms of moral truths, the battlewith the enemy becomes a moral one. We (the good guys) are moral and they (theenemy) are immoral.The moralistic overtones create an evangelical fervor. The enemy isnt pictured asa group of misguided individuals who dont understand things as well as we do.Instead, they know what theyre doing and know that its wrong. Theyre actingdeliberately; theyre evil.This eliminates the need for the moralist to be tolerant or understanding of anyonewhose interests conflict with his. Instead, he can be aggressive, violent, nasty,vitriolic, outraged  because hes dealing with someone who is immoral and thus notdeserving, of benevolence. Its an ideal way to relieve the pent-up frustrations thatcome from having to bear the bad consequences that might come from living by thephilosophy.So the insecure individual looks outside himself for intellectual security. He hopesto find a philosophy that will guarantee him moral rightness, a leader to compensatefor his lack of confidence, and an enemy to justify whatever goes wrong.Unfortunately, he lives in a fools paradise. He still has to deal with the world and withthe consequences of his own actions.Meanwhile, the individual who recognizes his own sovereignty considers theconsequences of his actions to be the only standard of right and wrong. He knowsthat hes capable of seeing those consequences and reacting to them as necessary. Hecan change any course of action that doesnt work; he can handle change and surprisesas they occur. He can deal with whatever comes.He would feel insecure only if he had to act in accordance with someone elsesjudgment. He would be genuinely afraid if someone elses decisions were determininghis future.He knows that the future is uncertain. But hes willing to be vigilant  to checkthe results of his actions. And hes willing to be honest  to acknowledge any mistakesand correct them immediately.Hes found the only kind of intellectual security that makes sense  reliance upon hisown sovereignty.194Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldEmotional SecurityThe desire to be loved, to be understood and appreciated, is universal.Unfortunately, many people dont feel theyre worthy of such benefits, and so theyhope to have them guaranteed without having to earn them. They seek perpetual loveand understanding by getting married, by joining groups, or by having children.If you rely upon yourself, you know that you can find the kind of people who willappreciate you. If you rely upon marriage, family, or groups, you know intuitivelythat youre vulnerable; you can be deserted despite the guarantees. And you knowthat the appreciation isnt for what you are but instead for your role in the family orthe group.You may find someone to marry, but that doesnt mean hell always love you orthat hell understand and appreciate you. You can join groups, but dont be surprisedif you find a lot of other lonely people acting as if theyre having a good time.Only if you know that you have something to offer can you be sure youll beappreciated or loved. Only then can you hope to find someone wholl appreciate whatyou are.You have to earn anything you want in life  and emotional security is noexception. You earn it by living up to the standards that have meaning to you, findingother people who value those standards, and continuing to live up to those standards.Theres no final resting place  short of death  where you can stop having toearn what you want. If youre loved now, youll continue to be loved only if youcontinue to satisfy the values of the person who loves you.That fact should bother someone only if he doesnt feel that he is genuinelyworthy. Chances are that hes tried to live with an identity that isnt his own, and hesconstantly afraid that he wont live up to it  afraid that hell be found out anddeserted.Meanwhile, the individual who accepts his own identity knows that he issomething real, something honest, something worthy. He doesnt expect everyone toappreciate that  but he knows someone will. Hes willing to expend the effort tofind that someone (and others who are similar), because he knows the rewards areworth it.He recognizes that values constantly change. When a friendship is no longer in thebest interests of both parties, he accepts the ending of it. When a love affair ends, hedoesnt try to perpetuate it by appeals to loyalty, dependence, or the preservation of amarriage.Freedom from Insecurity195Because hes self-reliant and honest with himself, hes constantly growing. And soevery relationship he has is more fruitful than the ones that preceded it. He has nofear of the future because he knows the future can only mean better things for him.Emotional security is entirely within your power to achieve. When you recognizeand depend upon your own sovereignty, youll know that youre capable of findingand enjoying valuable relationships  no matter how those you know now maychange.The insecure person hangs on desperately to whatever exists in the present. Thesecure person accepts and enjoys whatever he has in the present, but as changeoccurs he feels no fear of the future. He knows that changes are only preludes tobetter things.SecurityInsecurity comes from vulnerability. The insecure person relies upon protectors institutions and people who will guarantee results for him. Because he knowsintuitively that his interests cant possibly be the paramount interest in someone elseslife, hes vulnerable and he knows it.He depends upon his rights to protect him, he hopes for safety and durabilityfrom his ability to make others understand him, he clings to situations that are nolonger right for him, and the constant frustrations of these situations only heighten hisinsecurity. He has good reason to be afraid of the world.But security is always possible  financial, intellectual, and emotional security.However, it can come only from the willingness to handle whatever comes and theknowledge that you can do so.The knowledge and willingness arent hard to come by when you form the habitof thinking in terms of the areas that you control. When you realize how much youcan do that doesnt depend upon the agreement of others, you know theres nothingyou cant handle.When situations are wrong for you, you can find better situations. You dont have tobe frustrated by trying to make those around you treat you better.If youre willing to depend upon the direct alternatives available to you, if yourewilling to be alert to changes as they develop, if youre willing to be honest withyourself and withothers, you have nothing to be insecure about  because theres nothing youcant handle.If you earn whatever you want, you know that its yours. Then life is anadventure. The uncertainty of the future is a challenge, not a source of dread.196Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldWhy, then the worlds mine oyster,Which I with sword will open. ShakespeareIn battle or business, whatever the game,In law or in love, it is ever the same;In the struggle for power, or the scramble for pelf, Letthis be your motto  rely on yourself! John Godfrey SaxeFreedom from Insecurity19724Freedom from ExploitationMany people explain their problems by describing themselves as exploited.Some feel they can never be free so long as the economic system exploits them.Others blame their poverty on businesses that sell them goods at exorbitant prices.On a personal level, some people attribute their job problems to exploitation bytheir employers or associates. Others complain about the continual mistreatment theyreceive from their friends, families, or lovers.Freedom from exploitation comes not from changing other people or the economicsystem; it comes from a recognition of the direct alternatives available to you. If you feelyoure exploited, its probably because you feel trapped in a situation to which there areno alternatives. But there are always alternatives.What Is It?By definition exploitation is usually considered to be the utilization of someone orsomething for purely selfish ends. But as weve seen again and again, all personsmotivations are purely selfish. You cant expect to deal with anyone who wont beacting in his own selfish interest  whatever it may be. So youll never be free fromexploitation if you hope to arrange things so that others wont act in ways they think willbring them mental well-being.Each person will act upon the best alternative he thinks is available to him. Sowhen you think someone is exploiting, its simply that hes doing what he thinks best.He may seem to be taking advantage of someone, but we also know that the otherperson (the exploited) is doing what he thinks best.And so we come to the key question: If someone is being exploited, why does hepermit it? Why does someone willingly put himself in a position where it appears to usthat hes being taken advantage of?Lets look at some examples of exploitation in different kinds of relationships tosee if we can get an answer.198Personal RelationshipsIve often been bored by someone telling me over and over again how his spousemistreats him, how his friends take advantage of him, how his boss abuses him, howhis lover uses him. Why does he permit it? Why doesnt he terminate therelationship rather than allow the same person to exploit himover and over again?22Obviously, the individual permits it because he believes its the best alternativeavailable to him. He might wish he bad a better alternative, but he doesnt know ofany  and so he stays where he is.Its surprising, then, that he usually aims his bitterness at the person hes dealingwith, when he really wishes that someone else would offer something better.I think its a general rule that if you feel youre being exploited, the person youredealing with is usually the last person you should blame.In a sense, an individual can be made to suffer for his good qualities. For its his goodqualities (those that you value) that make him attractive to you. Otherwise, youdsimply ignore him. But because he seems to offer you something, you want to beinvolved with him. And if theres something about him you dont like, you can betempted to try to change him.But it wont work. Each person is what he is. To try to change him is to frustrateyourself with an indirect alternative. The resentment that many people call beingexploited is usually the result of such frustration. Your only direct alternatives are tolook for someone better, or to change the nature of the relationship so that hisdifferences dont have to get in the way (as we saw in Chapter 18).If there are better alternatives available to you and you dont take advantage ofthem, then its you who is abusing you.You dont have to be involved with cheaters, frauds, cheapskates, liars,demanding people, or anyone else you dont like. Its up to you to choose the peopleyoull deal with.Friendships dont have to be excuses for continual demands. And love affairsdont have to include constant arguments or sacrifices. If your situation does, itsbecause youve chosen to permit it.Youll free yourself from such exploitation only by enlarging your range ofalternatives. What other way is there?Freedom from Exploitation19922And why do I permit myself to be bored by such complaints over and over again?Economic ExploitationIve often heard it said that the profit system allows businessmen to exploitworkers. The working conditions during the Industrial Revolution are frequentlycited as evidence; men, women, and children were supposedly forced to work interrible conditions for little pay.Again, the question to be asked is: Why did they permit it? Why did they work insuch miserable conditions?The only conceivable answer is that they wanted to. Individuals left their farmsand other occupations and migrated to the factories because it was an improvementover what was available to them before.You probably wouldnt work twelve to fourteen hours a day in a hot, stiflingfactory for a dollar. That is, you wouldnt do it in 1973. But millions of people did sowillingly in the nineteenth century  because that was better than otheropportunities.Should the businessmen be blamed for improving the lot of the workers?The introduction of machinery made it possible to produce more in the same numberof man hours. Consequently, profits went up, wages went up, and prices dropped.People bought more because they could afford more at lower prices. And manycompeted for the factory jobs because the work offered an opportunity to improve theirliving standards.There isnt any other logical explanation. To think otherwise is to assumesomehow that millions of people gave up good pay and good working conditions todebase themselves in factory work.Without the Industrial Revolution, most of us today would be working on farms,barely producing enough to feed ourselves, making our own clothes, living withoutthings we now consider necessities, working twelve or more hours every day of theweek.And without the profit system, the Industrial Revolution probably never wouldhave happened. Men were inspired to create improvements in production because ofthe rewards they could get from them.The men who made millions of dollars from the innovations provided far morewealth to other people. Otherwise, those other people wouldnt have paid them forwhat they did. No one pays money if he thinks he has a better alternative.Its ironic that the men who are pictured as symbols of greed and exploitation arethe ones who have done the most for other people. It would seem that most peoplearent happy with the things they take for granted.For example, if Henry Ford had been prevented from making his billion dollars,we might have been deprived of the availability of low-cost mass-200Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldproduced automobiles. If you dont think automobiles are a blessing, you dont haveto buy one, of course.I fail to see how weve been exploited by people who have advanced ourstandards of living and become wealthy in the process. The General Marketdetermined how much their services were worth to people. And for every person whobecame wealthy, there were hundreds who tried but didnt offer what people wanted.If the people who gave money to the men who became wealthy had felt they werebeing exploited, they could have stopped it by not buying their products.CommercialismA frequent complaint is that someone is charging too much for his services. Buthe can be charging too much only if someone else is willing to offer the sameservice for less. If no one else will offer the service for less, how can we say the priceis too high?We hear of businessmen who exploit Negroes and others in the ghettoareas. Its said that they charge higher prices than are charged in other areasof the cities. If thats true, and theres no real need for the higher prices, itshould be a marvelous opportunity for someone to go into those areasand outsell the exploiters by charging lower prices.Why dont those who are concerned about exploitation do that? Theycould offer a humanitarian service and make a good profit while doing it.There must be a reason that they dont; and when you find that reason,youll know that no one is exploiting anyone.Theres no way anyone can get into a position where he can charge any price hewants to charge. For competition always exists  even if the competition isnt sellingthe same thing. A person who sells ball-point pens has to compete with people whosell other ball-point pens, pencils, fountain pens, typewriters, crayons, etc. If hecharges more for his pens than theyre worth to people, theyll find other ways ofsatisfying their needs.If a water company decided to charge $25 for the amount of water necessary towater your lawn, would you buy it? Probably not. Youd water your lawn less often.And if car prices are too high, you might buy a new car every four or five yearsinstead of every three.Individuals can always get by for short periods of time with minorinconveniences. But a lack of sales is a major inconvenience to a company. ItFreedom from Exploitation201has an investment to recoup, a payroll to meet. Most companies cant last very longon their reserves; they have to make sales.As a result, they charge the prices they think will bring them the greatest profit which means a price thats low enough to keep competition away and low enough tomake it profitable for people to buy their products.You dont have to buy from anyone. If you do buy, its because you value theproduct or service more than you value the money youre spending.To resent a price is to wish that the seller would be kinder and charge less orgive more in return. Thats wishing that the other person were less selfish than you are.And while that would be nice if it were possible, it isnt possible. So why even thinkabout it?No one has to produce for others; hell do so only when he believes its to hisadvantage. And no one has to buy from anyone; hell do so only when its to hisadvantage. The desire for the service, together with available alternatives, willdetermine the price.Since no one has to produce what I want, Im relieved and grateful when I findthat the things I want are available. I feel fortunate that others have chosen toproduce the things Id like to have.I feel lucky that there are operas to see (I certainly couldnt produce one all bymyself), that there are so many different cars to choose from, that there are peoplewho produce phonograph records, books, movies, and the other things I like.Sometimes I might wish they had done things differently, but how can I object to thefact that they have produced the things I want?AlternativesIn the same way, the people I associate with on a personal level offer me morethan the other alternatives Im aware of. How can I complain? If I continue dealing withsomeone, Id better accept him as he is.Im grateful for every relationship Ive had. Because I seek happiness, Im on thelookout for better relationships and better ways to handle relationships. But if I findthem, that doesnt detract from the value of what Ive had in the past.You dont have to buy from anyone.You dont have to work at any particular job.You dont have to participate in any given relationship. Youcan choose.If you feel exploited, you have four alternatives available:202Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World1. You can stay and complain that youre being used;2. You can try to change the other person;3. You can change the relationship so that the other persons drawbacksdont affect you; or4. You can withdraw from the relationship and look for betteralternatives.Only the last two alternatives offer any hope for a better life.You just sap your strength when you become preoccupied with the drawbacks ofthe person you deal with. Hell continue to be what he is. Let him be that; it doesnthave to affect you.You can have so much more if you recognize your own sovereignty. In the finalanalysis, the only person who can exploit you is you  because you make all the finaldecisions for your life.Freedom from exploitation is perhaps the easiest freedom to get. All you have todo is to stop participating in any relationship  of any kind  that doesnt suit you.It is as impossible for a man to be cheated by anyone but himself, asfor a thing to be, and not to be, at the same time. Ralph Waldo EmersonFreedom from Exploitation20325Freedom from the TreadmillFreedom is living your life as you want to live it.Many people feel that freedom is impossible because of the many hours required forwork, because of their debts, and because they cant afford to live the way theyd like to.The treadmill enslaves many people who cant conceive that life could be anydifferent. They stay where they are, leaving things as they are, making changes only whensomeone else initiates them.But why should it be that way? Youre a sovereign human being with numeroustalents and a great many alternatives available to you. Whether you want to increase yourincome, reduce your working hours, get out of debt, or work in a less monotonous job,theres always a way. More than anything, the need is to use your imagination to look foralternatives.Several years ago I faced a large debt that had to be paid off almost immediately.At the time I was doing miscellaneous sales jobs for several different companies. Iwent to the manager of one of the companies and asked him what his worst problemwas. What he told me was something I couldnt do anything about, so I asked him whathis second worst problem was.In reply, he explained the difficulty he was having because various administrativepersonnel werent supporting the companys sales programs. I offered to give them aseries of saleslectures, and he accepted the offer. I created a lecture series, together with anincentive system that would reward the administrative personnel for their sales help.That one extra job led to others. After our initial discussion, the managermentioned many other problems to me and I had opportunities to solve some of them.Each problem meant extra money for me if I could solve it. The debt that hadbothered me was paid off very quickly.I remember the incident well, because the day before I saw the manager, I wassulking in my living room, saying to myself, Theres nothing I can do.Theres always something you can do. And usually the way to find out what youcan do is to ask. Ask your employer or your customer what he needs right204now more than anything else. He can probably name a dozen things  and one ormore of them may be things you can do.Solving ProblemsEvery problem you can solve means more money for you. A problem is a marketfor a solution. Be sensitive to the problems of everyone you do business with. If youdont see problems, ask about them. Almost everyone has irritating concerns thathed like to have out of the way. Treat each of these opportunities as a separatematter, with a separate fee for the solution of the problem  to be paid if you cansolve it.To make the most of the opportunity, always handle the problem for a fee  neverfor an hourly wage. Find out what it would be worth to have the problem eliminated,and then decide if that price would be worth your time to do it. If you contract in termsof objectives, rather than hours, youll probably find that your hourly income can betwo or three times as much as it would have been otherwise.There are always plenty of opportunities of this kind around  more than enoughto keep you busy without having to work for a salary or an hourly wage. Even duringtimes of high unemployment, the person who looks for unsatisfied needs will alwaysfind numerous profitable alternatives.Always try to determine the self-interest of anyone you deal with. And the bestway to discover that is to ask him. What does he need?Above all, remember that the person whos paying for the service decides whatits worth to him. Dont ever expect someone to pay for something unless he sees itas valuable to him. If youre sure hes being shortsighted, look for someone whoappreciates your value.Youre not a slave to anyone; you dont have to work for anyone. But neither isanyone a slave to you.You may feel your talents or skills are limited. But youd probably be surprised tofind how many things youre capable of doing that other people would gladly pay for.Once you start asking what people would pay to have done, that may becomeapparent.It doesnt hurt to make a list of your talents, just to remind yourself. Include allthe things youve ever worked at, along with your hobbies and the subjects youexcelled in at school. When you look at your list, you might notice many things youcould do for others that would be more rewarding than what youre doing now.Freedom from the Treadmill205Dont worry about college degrees and other credentials. When you offer to solveproblems and be paid on the basis of results, customers are usually unconcerned aboutdiplomas and other normal job qualifications.I know a number of executives who never went to college, salesmen andentrepreneurs who didnt finish high school, and professional men who neverbothered to get licenses. They simply look for people who want value for their moneyand offer it to them.New JobsWhy should you spend the only life you have in a job that doesnt excite you?There are undoubtedly many other things you could do  if youre willing to lookinto them.Daydream. What did you always dream of doing while you were growing up? Isthat still attractive to you now? If not, what do you dream of today? Whatever it maybe, take your dreams seriously. Why shouldnt you at least try to make your life whatyou want it to be?Did you always want to paint? Why not try it now? Maybe you wouldnt be aRembrandt  but you might still be a good enough painter to make a decent livingwhile doing what you want to do. You could even test it on the side without havingto forsake your present job until you know what you can earn from your painting.Did you want to be a lion tamer? Maybe you could still be one. If not, you mightbe able to find another interesting job dealing with animals.Did you want to be a movie star? Even if you decide theres no hope for that, whycouldnt you join a little theater group to see if you like acting and to determine if youhave any talent? If you do, you could then look for something more professional.Why should you have to resign yourself to a life you dont care for?Free TimeWould you like to work fewer hours? Theres always a way to cut down on yourworking time without reducing your income.I mentioned earlier the contracting arrangement I made with my employees. Icontracted with each of them for a specific result and no longer considered them asemployees. Each former employee was then free to use his time in any way he chose;the only requirement was that he deliver the work on time.206Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldEvery one of them performed his work in less time than he had before. Some of themused the new free time to make extra money elsewhere; others enjoyed the luxury ofworking fewer hours.You can use this principle in any kind of work. If you deal with customers oremployers on the basis of results, you dont have to go on the payroll  nor do youhave to punch a time clock or show up at the office. All your customer will demand isresults. Your time will be free to plan as you choose.I know a number of people  engineers, accountants, salesmen, secretaries,executives, and others  who would never dream of being on a companys payroll.They simply contact companies and offer to perform needed services for a given fee.They manage their own time and methods and never take on jobs they dont thinkwill be interesting.They often perform jobs that are similar to what the companys employees aredoing. But because they offer more than the employees do, they get betterarrangements.When you solve problems and satisfy needs, you put yourself in a unique position.Youre doing something for the customer that he isnt used to getting from others.The others are simply going along, taking orders, doing only what theyre asked todo. They arent looking for ways to be of greater value, so they dont enjoy greaterincome and opportunities.If you do, youll be a rare person. Youll have a natural monopoly in your area.Youll be irreplaceable in the eyes of someone, because there will be no one asvaluable at what you do.When youre in that position, you may be amazed at how easy it is to write yourown ticket.I know a woman who works for a company in a big city. Since its a largecorporation, it has bureaucratic rules and traditions that normally defy individualarrangements.She has a second home outside the city where she likes to spend her weekends.But the traffic problem makes it a struggle to get in and out of the city on weekends.Because shes unusually valuable to the company, she was able to arrange to be in theoffice only Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, so she can commute during times oflittle traffic. She does her work at her country home on Mondays and Fridays andaccomplishes more in that quiet setting than she could at the office.If she had asked her employer to grant her this request as a favor, hed havefound plenty of reasons regretfully to turn her down. But because shes demonstratedmany times over that shes unusually valuable, she has a naturalFreedom from the Treadmill207monopoly in her job. Her work is far more important to the company than herpresence in the office on Mondays and Fridays.There are always ways to arrange more free time if youre geared to thinking in termsof results  results for the person paying you and results for you.For example, you might be in a position to hire someone else to do the leastimportant parts of your work. Youd probably pay him less than you receive for thatwork. You can then use the extra hours to make more money or to enjoy yourselfmore.The keys to a non-treadmill life are to find out what other people will pay for and torecognize what youre capable of doing. Get in the habit of asking your employer andyour customers what they need and they arent getting. Get in the habit of thinking ofthings youd like to do but arent doing now. Get in the habit of making changes that giveyou time to enjoy life more.DebtsToo often, an individual remains on the treadmill because he has too many debtsto allow him to reduce his working hours. A great deal of freedom is lost when youhave to spend the present paying off the past.Ive never liked debt. Ive had plenty of it and I dislike the way it immobilizes. Tome, freedom includes the opportunity to spend money as I choose, to spend it at thetime I receive it.When I was much younger, I was once so deep in debt that I thought it wasfoolish to even think Id ever be out of it. I dont believe in bankruptcy, so I thought Iwas stuck for life.One day I totaled all my obligations and found that I owed $13,000. Because I wasmaking very little money at the time, the amount seemed so enormous that I thought itwas pointless to pay $50 or $100 against it.But I also began to feel that there wasnt anything more important to me thangetting rid of it. I resolved to try to reduce it by some amount during the next coupleof months. If the effort were to make my life too miserable, I could always go back tomy old spending habits; but for two months Id concentrate on the task.I kept a running total of my debts and reduced the total every time I made apayment against it. At the end of the first month, Id lowered it by only $400. Thatmeant it would take over two years to liquidate the whole amount.But it was fun to see the total go down. Before long, no purchase was as excitingas buying a position of less debt. I was inspired to take on extra jobs  because everyfee I earned meant a reduction of the total.208Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf it became necessary to replace a household item, I did it in the cheapestpossible way  knowing I could always improve upon it later. For now, cutting thedebt was my most compelling motivation.Once a momentum was created, the debt shrank faster and faster. Finally, I wastotally out of debt  seven months after Id believed it would be impossible to ever getout of debt. I happily gave up the austerity budget and went out and splurged on newclothes, dinners, and dates (paying cash, of course).What I did isnt necessarily what you will do  possibly it would be moredifficult for you. But I cite the experience as an example of how wrong it can be tothink there is no way out. Theres always a way out  once you make up your mindwhat is most important to you.If its important to you to be debt-free, then work extra hours, cut out nonessentialspending for a while, or sell items you dont need. Find a way to put yourself in the positionyoud like to be in. If you know why youre doing it, and its important to you to do it,you wont mind the temporary austerity.Small PricesIve also found that Im better off  during good times or bad  by neverworrying about small sums of money.John Kamen, publisher of the Forecaster, once told me that he never worriedabout any price under $10. Hed pay for anything under $10 without considering hisbudget or the possibility that it might be a waste. If someone created a dispute about$10, hed pay it without arguing.When he told me this, I realized that Id been doing the same thing. Ive alwaysdisregarded small sums because it seemed a waste of time to argue over them orworry about them. After hearing Johns rule, I set for myself a conscious limit of $100. IfI ever find that the limit costs me more than it saves me, I can adjust it. Until then, Irefuse to ponder restaurant prices, repair bills, or any other small expenditures.Meanwhile, I see people who will spend hours (if not weeks) pondering a $15expenditure. They feel they have to, because of their limited means. They neverconsider that their means are limited partly because of the time they waste overpennies.Such choices are subjective, of course. Some people love to shop for bargains,but many people think theyre doing so out of necessity. They may be costingthemselves more than theyre saving.Freedom from such concerns is important to me. Id much rather spend my timelistening to a Puccini opera than trying to choose between a $6 item and an $8 item.Freedom from the Treadmill209Your DecisionsYour life is yours to spend as you choose. You dont have to be wealthy; you donthave to be involved in a family; you dont have to be successful. If any of those thingsare a part of your life, it should be only because you choose them. There are no rulesfor what your life should be.When you decide what you want, its important to recognize that there are manythings you want. You can envision many more desirable alternatives than you couldsatisfy in a lifetime. Desires always exceed resources. Thats why you choose  tosatisfy the desires most important to you.Its essential to realize that you cant have everything, you cant do everything.Theres always a price  and the price can be expressed in the alternatives that mustbe given up for something.There are many things you could do with your life. But which ones do you wantmost? What would you be willing to give up in order to advance your career, tobecome famous, to be wealthy? Are you willing to set aside the next twenty years ofyour life for the possibility that you may become wealthy? Are you willing to foregothe leisure, the entertainment, the family life, and other things most people take forgranted?Always view your desires within the context of your whole life. There is anunlimited number of things you can do to make money. But thats the point: Sincethere is an unlimited number, you have to draw the line somewhere. Its unrealistic tosay youll do anything you have to to make money.To say that is to give up everything else in life that you might enjoy. So its bestto draw limits at the beginning  limits that are appropriate to your own nature. Ifyou do that, youll be less likely to be burdened by thoughts of what you could havedone to make more money. Youll know what you received in place of the extraearning hours.Ive always wanted to be rich, but Ive always been very lazy, too. One day I had itout with myself and decided that, given a choice, I would prefer a lower financialstatus to working long hours at something I didnt enjoy.I still wanted money for the things it could buy. But I established limits beyondwhich I wouldnt go to acquire wealth. I defined them clearly and they werecompatible with what I knew about myself. So I never had to feel guilty when Iwasnt working.For the past few years Ive worked only at things Ive generally enjoyed. I knewthat it was better to do that (no matter what the monetary return) than to commitmyself to a lifetime of intense effort and joyless drudgery.210Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldPerhaps it isnt surprising that Ive made far more money during these past fewyears than I ever made before. For Im much more valuable doing what I enjoy than Iam doing what is distasteful to me.If it hadnt turned out that way, I wouldnt be sorry. I made a choice that wasappropriate to my nature and I was quite willing to live by it  no matter what themonetary result. I knew I would never be happy living any other way.If youre not willing to give up the things that you enjoy, accept that and dontwaste your time and attention pining over what you should have done to be moresuccessful. Establish a set of priorities; place limits upon the effort youll make to beprofessionally successful; and then remind yourself of those limits whenever youretempted to be regretful.On the other hand, if wealth and achievement are what you do want  more thanparties, friendships, love affairs, family activities, more than anything  thenrecognize that and accept it. Do what is necessary to succeed and dont let anyonebrowbeat you with accusations that youre self-centered or greedy.Do what you want to do. But recognize that there are many things you want todo and you cant have them all. So establish priorities in your values and stick to theones at the top. When you have to give up the lesser values, dont waste your timebemoaning the loss of what could have been obtained only by giving up somethingmore valuable.The FutureAnother way many people keep themselves on the treadmill is by beingpreoccupied with the future. Its easy to justify a rigorous schedule in the present as aninvestment in the future. Many people work long hours, put up with disagreeableeffects of their work, and forego enjoyments  all because it promises a brighterfuture.But what if the future never comes? Who knows what will happen to theeconomy, to your ability to enjoy yourself, to the things youd planned to spend yourmoney for?I dont believe in committing my future to pay for indulgences of the present. Butneither will I sacrifice today for a vague, indefinite tomorrow. I could die next week.What then would be the worth of my well-laid plans for 20 years from now?It makes sense to enjoy yourself at the time when youre best able to do so mentally and physically. At 65, the luscious dreams of today may not be so attractive.So leave 65 to be handled at 65. Do what you can to be sure you can provide foryourself then  but dont put off your dreams until then.Freedom from the Treadmill211The time to be free, to start living, to enjoy yourself, is right now. Now is the timewhen you can best appreciate the unplanned hours that can be enjoyed as you chooseat each moment.If you dont have any free time or money, do something about that. If you dontknow where your time and money are going, stop everything and check yourexpenditures and activities carefully. Find out how youre spending your life.Get rid of all the nonessentials  especially those that are vague investments inthe future. Dont feel that you have to give sixty hours a week to your work unless thats what you enjoy most.Be free  free to act upon opportunities as they arise, free to take advantage of thethings youve wanted to do. Find ways to satisfy your dreams. After all, what is lifefor? If its really just a vale of tears, whats the point in being alive?I believe that life is to be enjoyed, to be tasted  or there isnt any point to it.Ive found ways to live freely and joyously  because I am convinced there is noother reason for living.I didnt become free by working 60 hours a week  except during very briefperiods when there were immediate and important rewards for doing so. I didntbecome free by accepting the routine that others expected of me.There will be plenty of people to tell you that you must go along with things asthey are, that you have no right to expect a happier, easier life, that there are otherpeople who have less than you do. But so what?Theres so much to be had from life. Theres pleasure and satisfaction and loveand entertainment and excitement. And there are enjoyable ways of earning212Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worlda living, and there are adventures, uncommitted hours, challenges, and happysurprises.Use your imagination. Look for alternatives. Dont settle for less than the kind oflife you need to make it worth having lived.Riches are for spending. Francis BaconWhy do you have to postpone moving to a warmer climate whereyou can swim all year until you are so old that youreafraid of the water?Freedom from the Treadmill213 David S. Viscott26Freedom from PretenseWeve seen how hiding yourself can cause all kinds of social restrictions to beimposed upon you. In the same way, little acts of dishonesty can be a surprisingly easyway to throw away your freedom.Its such a small thing to shade the truth a little  but the long-run consequences cancreate tremendous restrictions on your life.For example, suppose theres something you want to do, but if a given personknew about it there might be problems. So you tell a simple lie to him to cover yourtracks.Then one day youre with him and another person, and the matter comes up indiscussion. It becomes necessary to repeat or confirm the lie you told before. But theother person doesnt understand the inconsistency between what youre saying nowand something youve said to him before. So you have to invent an explanation thatwill satisfy both of them.Now whenever youre with either of these people, you have to remember theseparate fictions involved  to keep the original lie from being exposed. And it canbecome even more complicated as other people become involved.So to avoid revealing your actions to someone, you can eventually pay a verycomplicated and expensive price. If you admit to the second person that you lied tothe first, your honesty would be suspect in the future. No matter how you handle it,you pay for dishonesty.In fact, its a very easy way to jump into a box. When youve lied aboutsomething, your actions are restricted by the need to maintain the fiction youvecreated. You can no longer react freely and spontaneously to new developments; youalways have to keep your guard up to avoid doing anything that might reveal yourprevious acts.Ironically, I think dishonesty usually comes about as an attempt to avoid prices. Afriend, Lynda Raff, once pointed out that lying is an attempt to get something fornothing. Its the hope of being able to do something without the consequences thatwould naturally follow  the reactions of certain people.And yet, you usually wind up paying a higher price dealing with the problemsrequired to continue the deception.214The value of honesty is greatest to the person being honest. It may be helpful tosomeone else if youre honest with him, but youre helping yourself far more by yourhonesty.Problems of DishonestyHere are a few of the problems you can bring upon yourself by being dishonest:1. You have to remain on guard, using precious resources to cover uppast acts.2. You miss opportunities to be accepted for yourself, because yourehiding that self. The people who would like you as you really are willnever see you if you keep your real self hidden.3. Dishonesty toward others can lead easily to dishonesty towardyourself. Lying can become automatic. If youre very concerned withmaintaining an image, you can remember past lies more clearly thanwhat really happened. After a while, it may become impossible toremember what was true and what wasnt.4. This can lead to an anxious feeling that what youve obtained by lyingcant be preserved. You can feel that you dont really deserve whatyou have  and so you cant relax and fully enjoy it.5. Sooner or later someone is going to become aware of your dishonesty possibly because he has participated in it. Because he knows youvebeen dishonest in the past, he cant be sure youre being honest in thepresent. Youll have fewer alternatives available when your word cantbe accepted without question.Benefits of HonestyYou can avoid those problems by being honest and gain other advantages, too.Heres a brief summary of the various benefits I find that honesty brings:1. When you prove that youre willing to be honest  no matter what the short-term consequences  others will accept your word more easily. This can open upmany opportunities that wouldnt exist if your listeners had to wonder about eachthing you say.Freedom from Pretense215For example, when I was promoting my last book through radio and televisionappearances, I was often asked, Why did you write this book? I always answered,To make money.A public-relations man suggested to me that I be less honest. Dont admit youreselfish, he said. People dont want to hear that. You should tell them you wrote thebook to help people.I asked him how many times hed heard an author or politician say that he wasonly interested in helping people. He acknowledged that hed heard it many times and he also acknowledged that he never believed it when he heard it. And finallyhe admitted that he doubted that other people believed it either.He hadnt understood that I was helping myself, not hurting myself, by mystatement. If I were willing to admit my selfish intentions (usually the first thingsomeone would lie about), people could more readily accept other things I said whenthey knew I wasnt covering up anything.Honesty allows other people to relax around you. They dont have to be alert toevaluate the truthfulness of each statement. Consequently, theres more chance for yourwords to make an impact.2. Honesty allows you to relax, too. You can say what you think and mean and wouldlike to say  without having to check first to be sure your statements wont contradict aprevious remark.3. As you reveal yourself honestly, you often find that you didnt really know whatothers wanted to hear; you only assumed you knew. When you tell the truth, you maybe surprised to discover that it projects a more attractive image of yourself than one youmight have fabricated.Ive often found that others would reveal their feelings only after Id revealedmine frankly. When they saw that someone was willing to admit the truth abouthimself, they felt free to follow suit.4. When youve been honest with everyone youre involved with, youll knowyouve earned whatever you have  and youll feel much freer to relax and enjoy it.You wont have to fear that the truth might someday be revealed and destroy whatyouve achieved.5. Youll be free to share your innermost secrets with others. When you decidethat you dont have to fear the judgments of others, you wont be afraid to confide inthem. When you can verbalize your emotions and desires honestly, youll probablyunderstand them better and youll be able to satisfy them more easily.216Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldPlenty of EncouragementHonesty has many advantages, but somehow dishonesty continues to get a goodpress and plenty of encouragement. Both fiction and real life are filled with examples ofsmart and even noble people telling lies.I imagine youve seen in movies, books, and newspapers how people lie to getwhat they want, how they lie to avoid hurting someones feelings, how they disguisetheir own desires in a show of self-sacrifice, how politicians and diplomats lie(supposedly in the service of their countries), how lovers lie to arrange secretmeetings, and how little people lie to get even with big business.Perhaps the most common encouragement to lying is the idea that youre doingsomeone a favor when you lie to him.But I think that idea is dishonest in itself. When a person lies to protectsomeones feelings, hes most likely doing it to keep the person from disliking him. Aphony compliment usually isnt meant to make an individual feel better about himself;its meant to make him feel better about the person doing the complimenting.It doesnt work, though. He probably knows the truth already. If you lie to aperson about what he already knows, hell probably respect you less, not more.And you also hurt your credibility with anyone else who knows about it. Suppose,for example, that you and I are having lunch with Charley, whos known for his largenose. When Charley asks me, Do you think my nose is large?, I could answer, Ofcourse not, Charley.Later, you might ask me if I really meant my remark. Suppose I answer, No, butI didnt want to hurt his feelings. That may seem noble, but the next time I saysomething nice to you, youll have no way of knowing whether I meant it or wasjust trying to make you feel good. My so-called kindness has hurt my relationship withyou.Whats the alternative to lying? Do I have to be brutal and hurt Charley in orderto be truthful? No. Too often, the brutal truth is only a partial truth. When it seemsthat honesty has caused problems, the trouble is often too little truth, rather than toomuch.For example, when Charley asks me if his nose is too large, I could say, It sureis! Would that be the truth? Only part of it. It would be more completely honest tosay, You have a large nose  but it doesnt make any difference toFreedom from Pretense217me.Another example of too little truth is the person who angrily says, I hate you,and then excuses his venom by saying, Well, you want me to be honest,dont you? But is he being honest? Usually, such an individual doesnt really hate theperson  or he wouldnt be in contact with him to begin with.It might be more accurate to say, There are many things I like about you, but Idislike very much what youve just done. Or just I am very angry rightThat recognizes the broader context in which the issue at hand is only one smallpart. It makes quite a difference; honesty makes it much easier to deal with whatever hascaused the problem.So if you sometimes fear saying the truth, check first to see if perhaps theproblem is one of too little truth, rather than too much.And recognize that youre sacrificing your own reputation and reducing youralternatives when you lie as a supposed favor to someone else. Any problem he has infacing the truth is his problem. It isnt your duty to protect him from himself.100%An important principle underlies the examples weve seen in this chapter: Anindividual can be sure of your honesty only if youre honest with everyone.How can he be sure youre not lying to protect his feelings if youve lied toprotect someone elses feelings?If youve said youd lie only if its absolutely necessary, how can he be sureyou dont consider this situation an absolute necessity?If you say youd never lie to your close friends, how can he be sure he hasnt donesomething to be demoted from your close friendship?If you want to prove your honesty to someone, you can do it only by beinghonest with everyone. He can relax and accept what you say only if youvedemonstrated that youll be honest even when its uncomfortable for you to do so.I once had a lady friend who played the typical games with the phone company placing collect or person-to-person calls that were never completed, just to get aprearranged message through.Obviously, the phone company didnt create its facilities to enable people to sendfree messages. To use those facilities fraudulently is just as dishonest as lying tosomeones face.My friend justified her tactic by saying, But that doesnt mean Id lie to you!And I resent the inference that I would. Youre far more important to me than thephone company.218Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldnow.But thats the point. If shed lie to the phone company to save 85, why wouldntshe lie to me if she thought it would save our relationship  especially since she says Immore important to her than the phone company?You can prove your honesty to any one person only by being honest to everyone.Theres a greater difference between being 99% honest and 100% honest thanthere is between 70% and 90%. The first exception to your honesty destroys one of itsmost important benefits  the absolute trust of others.Testing YourselfMost people probably think of themselves as being basically honest, even thoughthey tell a few white lies here and there. In fact, it can be so habitual that it doesnteven register with the person as being dishonest.The Identity Trap can be compelling. One can be so anxious to put his best footforward that he doesnt even notice that it isnt his own foot.I find it valuable to test my honesty periodically. To do so, I pick a period of thirtyminutes or so when Im talking on the telephone or in person with others. I observeclosely everything I say. Did I speak the absolute truth as I know it  or did I say what Ifelt I ought to say in the circumstances?Through this test, I can discover whether Ive lied without being aware of it.If you use this test and realize youre lying sometimes, you can use a variation ofthe same test to get in the habit of telling the truth at all times.Take an hour when youll be talking with someone. Instead of checking yourstatements after you say them, think twice about them before speaking. Stop yourfirst impulse to speak, and check what you were about to say. Is it the truth? If itisnt, determine what is and say that.After an hour, you may be exhausted from the concentration. So dont overdo it atfirst. An hour each day might be enough to start with.After a few days of this, it becomes more automatic and requires less effort tokeep up. So you can increase the amount of time youll devote to the exercise.Eventually, you should discover that your first impulses to speak are truthful. Atthat point, the monitoring can be dropped; honesty will have become natural.The way Ive described the exercise might make it seem as routine as doing anhour of calisthenics each day. But theres a lot more to it.During the exercise time, you might face some decisive moments. Suppose youvebeen exaggerating your affection for your wife, and on the first day you try this sheasks if you love her? On the third day, you may be divorced.Freedom from Pretense219You might need to answer a question in a way that contradicts an important lieyouve been protecting for a long time. If youre not prepared to accept theconsequences of that, theres no point in undertaking the attempt.As I mentioned in the Box-Trap chapter, its foolish to start using a newtechnique before youre fully prepared to handle the consequences. You have to beconvinced the benefits are worth the discomfort that will accompany the adjustmentperiod.As with anything else, you can approach absolute honesty on a gradual basis. But itwould help to begin thinking of ways to handle the major adjustments that might berequired when you acknowledge major dishonesties of the past. I dont think itsworth doing unless youre prepared to go all the way with it eventually.If you do decide that honesty will be your policy, the rewards should far outweighthe problems. In fact, youll probably discover benefits far beyond anything I mightsuggest.You might develop valuable new relationships  even out of old ones. You mayfind that more people will respond favorably to you because your honesty is arefreshing difference. As you deal with others, youll probably feel a great sense offreedom when all need for pretense evaporates. Youll be able to forget about thecontradictions and complications you had to keep track of before.Let me warn you, however, that the only way to demonstrate your honesty is bysimply responding honestly to everything. The most ineffective way of demonstratingyour honesty is by saying, Im being honest with you.What You AreWhen you start reaping the benefits of honesty, all temptation to be dishonest mayfade away. Youll want to reveal yourself to others as you are  because youllknow thats the way to attract the kind of people who have the most to offer you.The real you has a lot more to offer the world than the lost-in-the-crowd faadethat so many people try to assume. Who wants one more person whose identity is justlike everyone else is trying to be?Ive found that my most useful assets are many of the things I used to try to hide my selfishness, my laziness, the ease with which I cry when I hear good music orsee good drama. Those things have helped me find like-minded people whoappreciate the same things. And those are the people Ive always wanted to be with not the ones for whom Id have to suppress myself.Ive found that suppressing embarrassing things about myself costs me far toomuch freedom to be worth it. So, if I feared that a given person might discoversomething I had been trying to hide, I went to him and told it to him220Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldmyself. The experience never failed to give me a wonderful sense of freedom. I nolonger had to worry about it; the price had been paid once and for all, and I didnthave to think about it again.In the same way, if there is something about myself that makes me self-conscious,I examine it closely. I invariably discover that its either nothing to be self-conscious about orsome minor trait that can be changed easily without changing what I am.IntegrityHonesty is displaying yourself to others as you really are. But, of course, you cant betruthful about something you dont know.And thats why its so important to examine yourself, understand yourself, andaccept yourself. Only when you know who you are can you honestly representyourself to others.The individual who doesnt know himself cant speak with authority abouthimself. He cant make promises, because he doesnt know himself well enough toforesee his future emotions and actions. He cant express authoritative opinions,because he doesnt really know what he believes.He uses the word I dishonestly. He begins statements with I think . . . buthes only repeating what hes heard. He says, I will. . . but he doesnt really knowwhat hes going to do.The word I is one of the most important words in the English language. Itrefers to a unique, individual entity, different from all others in the world. When youuse the word, you should be sure youre really expressing the unique, individual entitythat is you  not simply repeating something that sounded good to you.To be honest, you must know yourself well. And that involves integrity  whichis honestys twin asset. Integrity is knowing yourself well enough to be able to meanwhat you say.The person with integrity can use the word I with authority. He knows what hethinks  for hes thought it out for himself.An Uncluttered LifeThe effort to prevent discovery of facts about yourself can be costly and draining.But its perhaps the easiest self-destructive habit one can practice.Ive had to work with it  and work with it again. Its so important to me that Idont like to go for very long without rechecking myself to be sure IFreedom from Pretense221havent unthinkingly relapsed into dishonesty. And, unfortunately, sometimes myrechecking reveals that I have fallen back.But my efforts to correct it have been worth the trouble many times over.Discovering myself and displaying that self has brought me countless benefits,valuable friends, a clean, uncluttered life, and a wide expanse of freedom that I didnteven know existed until I tried being totally honest.As Ive said before, there may be more things depriving you of freedom than theparticular restriction that prompted you to pick up this book. Freedom can be lostthrough many traps, boxes, and temptations. And what seems to be harmless dishonestycan turn out to be one of the greatest restrictions of all.Dishonesty is a form of the Identity Trap. When you lie to someone, youre fallingfor the temptation to think that youll be more attractive (and get more of what youwant) if you appear to be something different from what you are.Learn to trust your own nature, your own identity. Accept it, live it, reveal it. Dontsuppress it; dont attempt to shade it with little lies and half-truths. When you do, youmiss so much of life and the happiness that can be yours.By being only what you are, you can awaken each morning to a new day thats anopportunity to seek whatever you want  with no previous deceptions to get in yourway.To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of tenthousand. William ShakespeareHow could you get what you want if the other person reallydoesnt see you as you?222Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World David S. ViscottPart III223A New Life27Who Are You?Perhaps the most important part of the quest for freedom is discovering yourself,and that can be the hardest part. When you try to live up to an image dictated byothers, it can be very difficult to know exactly who you are and what you want.Youre a unique individual  different from anyone else in the world. And whatyou are is revealed mostly by how you react to things around you  what pleasesyou and what causes you discomfort. These are the signals that let you know whatkind of life you crave, what will bring you happiness.Unfortunately, the signals become distorted if youve lived most of your life ininvolved relationships. If youve grown up living with your parents, then lived with aroommate, and then married, the people around you may have played a large part indetermining your tastes and values.Even if the people around you havent been demanding or tyrannical, youve still hadto consider them when making decisions. As a result, what you now consider to beyour tastes might be more a reflection of your past routine than of your naturalemotional needs. If so, your experiences might be much less than they could be perhaps pleasant, but not joyful and exciting.You need time alone to act completely on your own desires  to discover thekinds of entertainment that please you, to realize such things as what color youdmost like your living room to be, to daydream and discover what youre now missing.Your desires will be best learned when theres no one around to influence and inhibityou.Sources of InformationThere are three basic sources of information to tell you what you want most past experiences, daydreams, and new experiences. If you examine each of them moreclosely, youll discover a great deal about yourself that will tell you what kind of lifeyou need in order to be happy. Each of them requires time to yourself  time whenyou can do what you want to do and discover how much it pleases you.224Start by looking back over your life. Take some time alone and think about thingsyouve done before. Try to recapture those moments of full-bodied happiness times when you were almost dizzy with joy.Try to remember all such experiences, no matter how long past. Remember thejoy you felt  the feeling that for once you were totally satisfied. And then examinethe experience to try to determine what it was that made it so ecstatic.You might want to disregard such experiences if you think they cant be repeated.Maybe they cant. But why not create new experiences that are similar? Perhaps peoplewho were important to that happiness are lost to you now. But if you can understandwhat made those people so important, you can find others like them.Reminisce. Indulge yourself in your past joys. And then start to figure out howyou can make such things happen again.Your fantasies or daydreams are another important source of information. Mostpeople dont take their daydreams seriously. They consider them nothing more thanan escape from the rigors of the real world. Theyre unfree, and they dont believethat their dreams could be satisfied. But if taken seriously, dreams can provide themotivation necessary to break out of boxes.The next time you daydream, imagine that youre free to actually live theexperience youre fantasizing  totally free of all commitments, obligations, and boxes.Dont try to figure out how youll remove the restrictions; just imagine that theyrealready gone. In a later chapter, well look at ways to use your dreams to get rid ofboxes and leave you free to make the dreams a reality. But it begins by taking yourfantasies seriously, by using them to learn what you need to be happy.And the third source of information is to try new things. Be willing to test newexperiences  to discover your own responses, uninhibited by others reactions.These last two sources are the most dynamic ways to bring new interest andpleasure to your life. If you never feel intense enjoyment, the way to find some is toexperiment with new activities and new environments  paying attention to yourreactions.Do SomethingDo novel things. You may react in novel ways. Pay very serious attention to thosereactions  theyre telling you who you are.Experiment in imagination  daydream. Experiment in fact  taste newexperiences.Who Are You?225Your imagination will have to be cultivated. It isnt a machine that can be turnedon like a television set. You have to develop the art of imagining what you couldenjoy that isnt in your life now.Play, bit by bit, with little memories of delightful moments, days, years, places,people, ideas, wishes, dreams, stories, plans. Play with your imagination. See howgood you can become at fantasizing. Imagine the people involved, how you deal withthem, what you get from them.Notice, as you do, when you get the greatest joy from a situation youreimagining. Take that reaction seriously and make a note to see how you can turn thatparticular dream into a reality.Use your imagination to find better alternatives. If you later decide to stay whereyou are now, do so only because youve imagined many alternatives and none of themis better than what you already have.If possible, dont leave it all to your imagination. Sample. Actually play with theworld, open doors to fresh situations that are entirely new. Some of whats beyondthose doors will be dull  but a lot of it may be far more delightful than what youhave now.Even the experiments that dont pay off can help you to know what would payoff. If something doesnt please you, ask yourself what it was you craved but didnt get inthat experience. Then look for a way to get it.Naturally, be cautious about the consequences of these explorations. There arelimits to the ways you can experiment without becoming vulnerable to bad long-termconsequences. But within those limits is a world of new and surprising adventures.Youll make mistakes and even be hurt occasionally, but dont let that stop you fromtrying new things.Some new possibilities may seem foreign to you, but perhaps only because of aroutine youve settled into. As you change your circumstances and removerestrictions from your responses, your emotional reactions to various things can bestronger and different from what they were before. Ive found this to be very true inmy own experience.For example, I once thought sex was overrated and often nothing more than aburden. Now that Ive learned what I like and Im free to seek and find it, sex is atotally new, excitingly wonderful means of expression and satisfaction. If I had reliedonly on my previous experiences, Id never have known what I was missing.In the same way, Ive discovered new entertainments, new foods, new intellectualadventures, new challenges  since I removed the boxes from my life. As a result,Im far more willing to try new things and to try again activities Id previouslyrejected.226Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldLife has so much to offer that can provide profound and durable happiness.Theres so much to discover that can enable you to spend more of your timegenuinely enjoying life, rather than just passing the time. Youll find those new joys ifyou take advantage of past experiences that have been fruitful for you, if you takeyour daydreams seriously, and if youre willing to try new things.Accept YourselfI realize that the search for yourself can be a bit frightening sometimes. Weve alllived with external standards that can conflict with our natures. And when youdiscover something about yourself that doesnt suit the accepted standards, you maynot be willing to accept your discovery.The critical points in your self-exploration are the moments when you dislike whatyou find. If you ignore the discoveries, youre rejecting the opportunity to find a wayof life that will bring you happiness. Youre resigning yourself to a life in the IdentityTrap.You are what you are. If what you are seems wrong, it might be becauseyouve accepted standards that are wrong for you.Or it might be that you havent probed deeply enough  or that you havent yetlearned how to gratify your desires without bad consequences.Suppose, for example, that you discover that you have an urge to steal. Yourimmediate reaction might be a desire to ignore the discovery; it may seem that even toacknowledge the discovery will get you into trouble.Not necessarily. If you probe more deeply, you might find your urge to steal isonly a superficial symptom of a more basic desire  perhaps the desire to havemoney, or the desire to get away with something, or the desire to rebel againststandards that youve seen advocated in a smug, self-righteous way.If you fight your initial discovery, youll never come to understand the more basicmotivations within you  motivations that might be gratified without the badconsequences that can come from stealing.Dont feel that to find some desire in yourself is to be compelled to a givencourse of action. Once you know what you are, you can find ways to make the mostof that without getting into trouble. But youll never find those ways if you dont firstaccept what you see in yourself.It may take time to acquire that sense of self-acceptance, but it will come if youlet it  and it will bring with it a greater happiness than you could find living in theIdentity Trap.Who Are You?227An ExampleIve mentioned my laziness before. How I discovered it is an excellent example ofthe difficulty of self-acceptance.For years I assumed that I was a productive, achieving individual. I wanted todemonstrate my ability to make money and accomplish more than other people could. Iassociated with people who seemed to reflect those values; often they were successful,self-made business and professional people.I was always a little uncomfortable around them, partly because I was never assuccessful as I thought I should be. And when I was alone, it was always more appealingto relax and listen to good music or curl up with a novel, rather than to spend my time inintellectual pursuits, or to lay out grandiose plans, or to make extra efforts to achievemore.Naturally, I felt very guilty about my private preferences and activities. Inaddition, I was in debt and, although I was making a fair living, it seemed that I wouldalways be in debt if I didnt work harder. I wasnt very happy.Whenever the thought struck me that I was really very lazy, I rejected it. I didntwant to be lazy. What would my friends think of me? What about the standards Iespoused? How would I ever get out of debt? The apparent consequences were toohorrible for me to accept my own laziness.I cant tell you exactly when I made the breakthrough, for it happened over a periodof time. But eventually I became willing to accept my laziness as a part of me.As I learned to accept that facet of my nature, I made changes in my life. I nolonger tried to carry out plans that required more effort than I was capable of giving. Ilooked for ways to make money that capitalized on the things I could do best (and thusrequired fewer working hours) and which I enjoyed doing. I stopped worrying whatmy friends would think and looked for friends who were more relaxed, lesscompulsively active and productive, and more willing to accept pure enjoyment as arespectable activity.Dramatic improvements appeared in every area of my life. Friendships andromances became genuine pleasures instead of situations in which a false image hadto be maintained. I spent more time with good music and novels. I found new ways toenjoy myself  ways I could enjoy freely, for the burden of guilt was gone.I constructed a realistic scale of values for myself. I realized that monetarysuccess might cost me too much in discomfort to be worth the effort, so I willinglysettled for a life with less strain  even if that also meant less money.As it turned out, my new way of life brought me more money. When Iconcentrated on the work I enjoyed, my work became more valuable to others228Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldand I was paid more for it. Not only that, but I enjoyed working more than I hadbefore. And I made more money than Id even hoped to make before.The acceptance of my laziness was so rewarding that it inspired me to take otherrevelations about myself more seriously. And I was able to use those discoveries toadvantage, too.I became more honest with others; I no longer said what seemed proper. I saidwhat I believed to be true. I was able to speak freely, without embarrassment, of whatI wanted and needed. When I did, those who werent valuable to me drifted away andthose who had something to offer made themselves known to me.My example may be far removed from any problem you have in your life now. Icite it only to demonstrate the importance of self-discovery. Its easy to be afraid of a traityou discover in yourself, but dont jump to conclusions; dont think that the moreobvious consequences of that trait are the only ones.First take yourself seriously  and then find out how you can act upon what youfind without bad consequences.Changing YourselfAfter recognizing and accepting what you find in yourself, you might still bedissatisfied with something about yourself thats in conflict with other, moreimportant parts of your nature. If so, you can work to improve any part of yourselfthat displeases you.Understand, however, that the change will probably be a long-term project.Dont let it interfere with what does make you happy in the interim. As hopeful as youmay be, the change may never be successfully completed  so it would be foolish tothrow away the happiness you can have in favor of something that might never be.People often get into trouble by thinking that they can change themselves just bydeciding to. They decide theyre going to be different from what theyve been, andthen make plans based upon their new images  plans that never work out becausetheyre unrealistic.Always act with a recognition and acceptance of what you are at that moment.Dont expect to accomplish feats that require talents you dont have; dont ignoreyour weaknesses; dont act as if you were someone other than who you are. Work toimprove yourself in any way that seems right to you; but in the interim, act in ways thatare consistent with what you are at that moment.You are what you are. That doesnt mean youll always be the same  but whatyou do right now will succeed or fail in terms of what you are this minute.Who Are You?229Your DesiresAs you look for ways to be happier, there are two types of desires to beconsidered.One is the long-term way of life you want for yourself. That can include suchthings as the kind of work you want to do, the long-term love relationship you mightbe seeking, where youdlike to live, the improvements youd like to make in yourself. It can also include along-term plan to create a new free life for yourself that includes fewer commitments,obligations, debts, and responsibilities.The other type of desire is the short-term pleasure you seek. That can includeminor romances, various entertainments, traveling, projects, or hobbies youvewanted to try  anything that doesnt involve long-term plans.Your personal morality can be of value in both areas. It can remind you to keepyour eyes on the long-term goals youve set for yourself. And it can act as a monitor toassure that short-term pleasures dont interfere with your long-term plans.Dont feel that you have to know all your long-term goals right now. In fact, youshould never set a long-term goal until youre fairly sure that its attainment will trulymake you happy. Even then, be prepared to alter it as you and your circumstanceschange. Dont ever be ashamed to change your programs as new information revealsbetter ways for you to be happy; just dont make important changes too suddenly orwhen your emotions are in control.Until youre sure what you want for the long term, you can continue to live dayby day, enjoying what you experience, experimenting with new things. You donthave to decide upon a career by any given age; nor do you have to know right nowwhat you want most in a long-term love relationship. And theres no reason to commityour future before you know those things.In fact, short-term pleasures can evolve into long-term matters without your everhaving to make a formal decision. For example, as you work at various jobs, you mightfind one that suits you well enough to stay in it a longer time  without deciding thatit will be your final career. As your talents and opportunities in that field grow, youmight one day realize that you have made a career of it. Even so, you might still wish tochange it someday.In the same way, if you accept each romantic relationship for what it offers you,you dont have to make a formal decision that one of them will be permanent. But itmay turn out that one of them will be  without any conscious attempt to make itso.When things develop in this way, you never have to make a long-termcommitment or final decision about anything. You just do what you enjoy doing230Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldthe most  and over a period of time, your pleasures can grow into lifelongenjoyments.AdventuresAs you seek to discover yourself and look for ways to make your life joyful, youmay often be told that you shouldnt be so preoccupied with yourself, or that youshould accept the life you already have, or that its too idealistic to expect to findgenuine, durable happiness in this world. You may see others spending their livesworking miserably to stay in their boxes.Realize that what they do is up to them. What you do is up to you.Your life can be an adventure  a continuing stream of new pleasures, excitement,and satisfactions. You can have meaningful, problem-free friendships; you can have lovethats intense and exciting without burdens and compromises; you can produce income inways that are fun; you can have thrilling experiences that dont lead to bad consequences.There are plenty of people who live that way. And some of them may have oncebeen locked in more boxes than those that restrict you now.My freedom and happiness werent achieved by compromising my standards toconform to the people around me. Neither did they come from a superhuman effort tochange people.Im free and happy because I accepted myself as I am and found a life that suitsme  and it wasnt nearly as difficult as I had thought it might be.As I lie on my couch by the fireplace, looking out from my hillside home at thesnow leading down to the ocean, with the right woman in my arms, a glass of Bordeauxbeside me and a Puccini opera on the stereo system, knowing that Ive earned thepleasure I feel, Im so glad I didnt let someone else decide whats best for me.To be nobody but yourself  in a world which is doing its best,night and day, to make you somebody else  means to fight thehardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stopfighting.Who Are You?231 e.e. cummings28Your Own MoralityA personal morality is a systematic attempt to recognize all the relevantconsequences of your acts. Its purpose is to prevent you from doing something hastilythat might interfere with your long-term goals.Many people might think that the idea of creating your own morality isoutrageous  that you should accept whats been handed to you by others (in theinterest of society).But a personal morality is simply the making of rules for yourself that will guideyour conduct toward what you want and away from what you dont want. And therules are made by examining alternative sets of consequences in important matters.Your knowledge will tell you what consequences you believe will ensue from anygiven action; and only your values can tell you whether those consequences are goodor bad. So your rules will be consistent with your nature and your goals only if youvecreated the morality for yourself.The temptation to act immorally is usually the result of trying to be moral in away that isnt really suitable to you. But if youve thought things out for yourself,youll develop principles you can live with comfortably  principles that match yourunderstanding of reality, principles that can help keep you pointed in the directionyou want to go, principles you can act upon without mixed emotions.A clear-cut morality is like a boundary line. Beyond the boundaries set by yourmorality, you know you can run into trouble. Within the boundaries, you can act freelyand spontaneously because you believe no problems will be caused by your short-termenjoyment.CrisesIf you construct your morality carefully, it should serve you especially well in acrisis. The worst time to reconsider long-range principles is during a crisis. Whenemotions are intense, its very difficult to see realistically all the consequences thatmight ensue from your choices.232At such a time, your principles should already be clearly in mind. Your onlyconcern should be with the specific facts of the situation  to which youll apply theprinciples you already hold.You might make important changes in your morality at other times; thats amatter of being humble enough to realize that you can grow. But its unrealistic tobelieve you can make useful changes in your principles during a crisis.So anticipate the various kinds of circumstances in which you might someday findyourself. Now is the time to determine the principles by which youll act if suchconditions should ever arise. For example, are there circumstances that would make itright for you to coerce your child? If so, what are they? To stop him from takingdrugs? And would you coerce someone who was trying to induce your child to takethem? At what point would you intervene?It doesnt help to say, My child would never do that. Someday your child willwant to do something that goes against your wishes. Where will you draw the linebetween letting him do as he chooses and coercively intervening to stop him?As you think about it, ask yourself what the consequences of your interventionmight be  and also what the consequences of non-intervention might be. Thendecide at what point the consequences of one outweigh the consequences of the other.The result is your moral rule for that issue.These things must be decided in advance. You might alter your judgment in thefuture, as you gain new insights. But a crisis could occur at any time  and you needto have firm, realistic, believable principles available to you when it does. Otherwise,you could throw away a large part of your future by making a rash decision.Recognize ExceptionsAs you decide upon such principles, the rules should be formed in a way thateliminates any need to break them. Exceptions should be recognized as you create therules, and then incorporated into the rules.For example, one of my rules is, Never be or appear to be something other thanwhat you are. I see mostly bad consequences from lying. At the same time, I recognizethat no consequences will matter to me if Im dead. And there are also certain peoplein the world who are very valuable to me; if they were to die, Id lose a great deal.So it becomes a question of which of these values is more important to me. Ivedecided that my survival and the survival of those most valuable to me are moreimportant than avoiding the bad consequences of dishonesty. My moral rule musttake that into consideration.Your Own Morality233As a result, it would be more complete and more realistic to phrase it Never lie orappear to be something other than what you are  unless youre sure your life or the lifeof someone very important to you is literally at stake.In a life-or-death emergency, Ill lie if I must. I know why Ill lie and Ive alreadymade that decision.If I lie, Ill suffer the bad consequences that I know come from lying. But Ill do sobecause a superior value will be preserved  my life. I wont justify the lie by pointingto the circumstances; that wont change the consequences of dishonesty. When Isuffer those consequences, Ill know that Im paying a necessary price for remainingalive.Because my rule already includes exceptional circumstances, therell be no needto wonder during a crisis if I should change it. Ill know which way to act  and Illbe prepared for whatever comes.And because I recognize these things now, I can do more to avoid getting myselfinto a situation where I must choose between my honesty and my life. That would bea negative decision  one in which either choice would cause problems  and itsimportant to avoid negative decisions.Moral QuestionsTo help you construct your own morality, here is a list of moral questions that Ithink require answers. Your answers should be your own, but I think its importantthat you do have answers for them.1. In what circumstances would you steal, if ever?2. How honest should you be? Do different relationships deserve differentdegrees of honesty? If so, on what basis can you decide the degree ofhonesty appropriate to the relationship? (If you know in advance thecircumstances that warrant lying, youll be less likely to feel guiltywhen you do so in accordance with your rules.)3. When would you use physical force to protect yourself? In whatcircumstances would you use it to get something you want? To whatextent would you use it to repel an intruder from your property?4. In what circumstances would you go to the aid of a stranger? Whenwould it be unrealistic to do so?5. Would you interfere to stop a fight between a friend and someone else?Between two strangers?234Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World6. In what circumstances would you accept a government subsidy? (Ifsuch a question is important to you, recognize that there are manykinds of subsidies  public schools, government contracts,Medicare, for example.)7. What is the limit to which youll go to satisfy your parents wishes?Your friends wishes? The wishes of your lover or spouse?8. How much sympathy, attention, or help are you willing to give yourfriends? Is there a limit? If so, what is it?9. In what circumstances should you not act sexually as you want to atthat moment?10. Are there any circumstances in which you would allow your owndesires to be overruled by a group decision? If so, whatcircumstances?11. How involved should you be with someone whose answers to theabove questions are quite different from yours? Which of the issuesinvolved are the most critical to you?In each case, ask yourself what consequences you could expect from various differentanswers to these questions. Picture yourself in such circumstances and act them outmentally. Follow each situation through until you see the consequences taking place. Seeif your actions will in any way affect future relationships with others.When you have a good answer to a question, check to see if it includes all possibleexceptions within the rule.It would be helpful to write out your answers. You may be surprised by how muchmore precise you can make an answer once youve seen it on paper. If you dont feelinspired to write them out, try saying them aloud  or better yet, into a taperecorder.If your first efforts seem rough or unsure, keep at it. That way youre more likelyto get answers you can live with  and live well. When you verbalize your answers on paper or aloud  theyll be more real and more precise.Make a note of anything covered in this book that you believe is significant toyour life. It doesnt matter whether you agree with my views; the important thing isto call attention to issues you feel you should think about in more detail. Whenyouve finished the book, go back and review those issues; think about them until youhave answers youre satisfied with.There are undoubtedly many important issues other than those questions Ive listed.As you think of them, make notes so you can consider them later in detail.Your Own Morality235The range of issues might seem to be limitless. But as you develop a set ofprinciples for yourself, youll probably find that many apparently new issues arealready covered by principles youve formed.The process of forming a personal morality isnt something thats completed in anhour or two. Youll undoubtedly adopt some conclusions that are rather tentative, tobe superseded later by more thoughtful and confident answers. If you continue togrow in your knowledge and insight, youll want to amend conclusions accordingly.Dont rush; the job may take years  but its worth it. And what could be morestimulating than thinking about your own life?My RulesTo stimulate your thinking further, heres a list of some of my most importantmoral principles. As you look at them, ask yourself what you think about them  andwhy. Ask yourself what youd expect to be the consequences of acting by these rulesand of not acting by them.As youll see, most of these rules are framed as negatives  prohibitions uponactions that might get in the way of my long-term goals. The more positive rules willdepend more upon your personal values and goals; theyll be rules that attempt to keepyou aimed in the direction most attractive to you.1. Never expect anyone to act from your knowledge, perspective, orobjectives. Assume that his viewpoints will differ in some ways fromyours.2. Never make an important decision when your emotions are dominatingyour mind.3. Never lie or appear to be something other than what you are  unlessyoure sure that your life or the life of someone very important to youis literally at stake.4. Never invest any resource (time, money, emotional involve ment)that youre not prepared to lose.5. Never take on a new responsibility, time commitment, or liabilitywithout recognizing what must be given up to accommodate it.6. Always leave some free time in your schedule to take advantage ofnew opportunities as they arise. If there are no new opportunitiesduring the period, the free time can always be used for pure pleasure.236Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World7. Never use someones property in any way that he doesnt approve of unless your life or the life of someone very important to you isliterally at stake.8. Never focus your attention on anyones weaknesses  his temper,sloppiness, poor logic, dishonesty, whatever. Recognize theseshortcomings, take them into consideration, but dont waste yourtime complaining about them. Instead, pay attention to what youractions should be in order to deal with him.9. Never quibble over a price you didnt expect to pay. Pay it and moveon to better things.10. Never form a partnership (an agreement in which responsibilities orrewards will be shared) for any purpose.11. Never become directly involved in violence unless it appears to be theonly alternative to prevent more serious injury to yourself or to someonevery important to you.12. Never forsake your rules because of someones actions or opinions.These are only a few of the rules I live by, of course. Others are mentionedthroughout the book. And there are others that I take so much for granted that itwouldnt occur to me to mention them.Rule #12 is especially important. Many philosophies encourage the idea that its moralto respond in kind to something someone does  whether that be lying, cheating,stealing, or violence.I believe that the consequences of an act will be pretty much the same, no matter whatprovokes it. It would be to my disadvantage to lie  even if I were lying to a liar.If I lied to someone and then justified my action by saying that the person I lied to hadalready been dishonest toward me, my relationship with friends might not be the same inthe future. For they could never be sure that a misunderstanding hadnt caused me tobelieve I was justified in lying to them.23The same principle applies to stealing, violence or any other action thatsnormally prohibited by your morality. If others choose to lie, steal, make emotionaldecisions, or engage in violence, that doesnt change the consequences to you of yourown actions. Dont allow others to run your life23An interesting question concerns whether you should lie to the government, and how thatmight create consequences in other areas of ones life  a question I leave to you to sort out.Your Own Morality237indirectly by letting their actions dictate yours. Make your own decisions based uponthe consequences to you.Your LifeIts also important to decide for yourself how much you believe you can get fromlife. Obviously, you shouldnt adhere to a code thats based upon goals you dont believecan be achieved. And you need to decide how much effort each of your goals is worth.Dont allow the standards of others to influence you. Different people, with differentviews of life, have different ideas about what is possible. Let them choose for themselves and you choose for you.If you determine for yourself who you are, what will make you happy, and what codeof conduct is consistent with that, youll be able to act more freely and with moreconviction. You wont be hindered by prohibitions that arent appropriate to you and you wont jump into potentially dangerous situations just because others aredoing so.Youre not acting irresponsibly by choosing for yourself. Your actions willproduce consequences that youll have to live with; youre accepting that fact whenyou create a morality for yourself. What could be a greater example of responsibilitythan an individual who chooses for himself and is prepared to accept theconsequences of his own choices?The irresponsible person will refuse to take the credit or blame for his ownactions. Hell say that he did what he did because he was obeying a moral law, orbecause he didnt want to hurt someones feelings, or because society wouldnt lethim do otherwise. Hes disclaiming the responsibility for his own acts.A free person has no one to blame. He has no boxes, no restrictions, no enemiesto take the responsibility for his actions.But because hes free, he can choose for himself to create a personal moralitythat fits his view of reality and will help him live in the way he wants to live.If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it isbecause he hears a different drummer. Let him step to themusic which he hears, however measured or far away. Henry David Thoreau238Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World29Is your Life What You Want It to Be?When you find an attractive long-term goal, its easy to be induced to take onobligations that seem necessary to attain it. Unfortunately, however, years later theobligations may have turned into burdens  and the burdens can remain long after thegoals have been reached or even discarded.For example, an individual gets married because hes in love and wants to enjoylove, affection, appreciation, and understanding for the rest of his life. A year or twolater, the love has evaporated  but the structure that was erected to achieve thegoals still stands. The negative side of marriage remains long after the positive goalshave been discarded.In smaller ways, routines in your life can continue long after theyve ceased to bevaluable. Its easy to maintain pointless activities without reappraising their relevance toyour current goals.So its important to periodically recheck your assumptions, reappraise youractivities, and reexamine your goals to see how much relevance they still have to yourhappiness.One way to do that is to make a list of the things you do with each of the 168 hours in atypical week. Include every one of your routine activities, including eating andsleeping. Then apply labels to each of the activities to help you determine how muchyoure getting out of those hours.There are four kinds of labels you can use  each of which will help you appraiseyour life from a different perspective.1. Good-Bad LabelsThis set of labels will identify how much of your precious time is being used in waysthat add to your happiness, and how much is being wasted.Use the three labels good, bad, and indifferent. Put the good label on anythingthat makes you feel good. Put the bad label on the things that cause you discomfort,the things you dread, the activities that seem to be prices to be paid. And apply theindifferent label to those things that seem to be neutral  whatever provides neitherpleasure nor discomfort (brushing your teeth perhaps).239Dont apply a label in accordance with what an activity ought to be. For example,dont automatically label an activity good just because it's supposed to beentertainment. Maybe you play poker with the boys because its a habit. Or perhapsyou go out to dinner every Sunday only because youve done that for years. Ormaybe you play bridge with the Culbertsons on Wednesdays because youve neverthought of anything better to do.Dont consider something enjoyable just because you dont know what youd doinstead. You wont find anything better until you first establish that youre not satisfiedwith what youre doing now.On the other hand, the fact that you work forty hours every week doesntnecessarily mean that its unpleasant and must be labeled bad. There may be parts ofit that you enjoy and parts you dont. If so, separate the general category work intospecific hours to be individually labeled.The indifferent label is mostly a catch-all for those things that seem to defy eithera good or bad label. There are many activities that you wouldnt consider unpleasant,but which add no enjoyment to your life (going to the mailbox, eating breakfast,walking the dog, reading the newspaper, etc.).As you look at items labeled bad, ask yourself, Why am I continuing theseactivities? If you answer, Because theyre necessary, get tough with yourself anddemand to know why they cant be eliminated. If its a box that youre maintaining,find a price and pay your way out.And be impatient with the items labeled indifferent, too. Some of them mayindeed be necessary to stay alive, but a lot of them may be just ways of passing timewhile waiting for something to happen. Start daydreaming and exploring to find newactivities that can make more exciting use of your time.It isnt necessary that your life be full of bad and indifferent activities. Take aclose look at your present routine and rearrange things so that a great deal of yourtime is spent more enjoyably.2. Positive-Negative LabelsNow analyze the list of your weekly activities from a different perspective, usinga different pair of labels.Label each activity either positive (those things you choose to do to increaseyour happiness) or negative (those things you do in order to avoid unhappiness).A positive label would be attached to a Sunday afternoon in which you have nocommitments, and can choose among several ways to enjoy yourself. A negative labelshould be applied to a Sunday afternoon you must spend with your relatives  if yourmotive is only to avoid recriminations and family turmoil.240Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldAfter youve applied labels to your entire week, you should have a pretty goodidea how much of your life is yours to enjoy as you desire. If it isnt much, startdismantling the boxes that tie up so much of your time.3. Active-Passive LabelsThis approach is similar to the last one. It will help you to see if youre makingthings happen in your life  or if youre just going along with what others want.Label each activity active or passive. The active label applies to anything youhave initiated, the things you do because you have decided they should be done. Thepassive label should be attached to those activities you do because someone elsewants you to do them.Do you simply react as other people initiate things? Do you find yourself hopingthat others will suggest the things youd like to see happen? If so, why dont you act?Why dont you initiate new, more enjoyable, more sensible activities? After all, othersmay never initiate the things you want to happen.No one knows better than you what will make you happy. If you dont ask forwhat you want, youll probably never get it. And if the asking or initiating is certain tomeet with rejection or problems among your current relationships, then ask elsewhere.As you apply these labels to your weekly activities, designate passive those thingsyou do only to preserve a relationship (even if its a relationship you value)  suchthings as conversations that bore you, favors, etc. As you look at the labels, you cansee how much of your time is necessary to preserve the relationship  and thatshould tell you if the situation is as compatible as youd thought it was.Look for relationships that dont require that you tolerate unpleasant things inorder to maintain them. With the right people, you should be spending most (if not all) ofyour time doing things that please you, that make sense to you  the things you wantto do. Compromises seem necessary only because of inappropriate situations. Ifyoure involved with the right people, the word sacrifice shouldnt even be in yourvocabulary.4. Production-Enjoyment LabelsNow analyze the list from one more perspective  to determine why youvetaken on these activities and to see if they still serve any valid functions.As you look at each activity, choose from five labels. The first is enjoyment that which brings you happiness right now (golf, sex, reading, TV, travel, etc.).Is Your Life What You Want It to Be?241The second label is past mistakes  anything you must do to pay for some costlything you did in the past (alimony payments, child support, installment payments onsomething no longer useful, effort expended to undo a bad deed, etc.).The last three labels designate activities that are supposed to provide happiness atsome time in the future. Theyre assumed to be productive. The payoff may be expectedsoon  or it may be a long-term project  or it may be something you now realizewill never come to fruition.The first of these three labels is productive  short-term, which applies toanything you expect will produce happiness in the near future. It can include any partof your working time that yields money you can spend enjoyably right away. It canalso apply to the time spent planning and preparing for a forthcoming activity that willgive you pleasure  such as arranging a party, building a boat, or planting a garden.Productive  long-term labels should be attached to projects that you hope willproduce happiness in the distant future. For example, you might be going to school toacquire a skill that will increase your income two or three years from now. It can alsoapply to the hours spent earning the mortgage payment that will give you a paid-forhome many years from now (if having a paid-for home is important to you).And as you appraise your weekly routine, you may discover activities that offerno hope of gain. They are the things you might have once undertaken with a definitegoal in mind that has since become irrelevant. Label those productive  never, andsmile as you realize that youve just found a few hours each week that will soon befree to be used for something new and more rewarding.That can include a language youve been studying because of a job youve sincechanged  or a business thats been losing money and will continue to do so  ortime expended for a community cause whose failure is obvious  or a marriage youdhoped would someday bring you love, but hasnt.Some activities can bear more than one label. Your job might be productive ofincome to be spent, but it might also include the enjoyment of various projects anddiscoveries  not to mention the more obvious things like entertaining clients atexpensive restaurants, coffee breaks with a cute secretary, or Rotary Club meetings ifyou enjoy them. So break your work week into individual hours  and apply the labels toeach activity in your work.The five labels identify those parts of your life that deal with the past (pastmistakes), the present (enjoyment), and the future (the three productive labels).You cant evade paying off the mistakes of the past, but you can look for waysto reduce the costs. And you can find ways to accelerate the payment so that youllbe free of them sooner.242Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldNeither can you disregard the future. Its important that you dont do thingstoday that must be paid for with regret tomorrow. But at the same time, its very easyto get into the habit of doing things that add nothing to your future but which arevaguely justified as being necessary for the future.When I review my activities with this technique, I immediately eliminate theproductive  never items from my life. I spend the most time appraising theproductive  short-term and long-term activities.Im very skeptical about long-term projects. In an uncertain, changing world, itstoo easy for them to become irrelevant by the time theyre completed. I try to keepgoals telescoped into the short term where they can be appraised realistically anddiscarded when they dont add to my happiness.Ive found that the most fruitful long-term projects have evolved out of short-term projects. The short-term projects have definite pay-offs at various points alongthe way; I never have to wonder for very long if Im doing the right thing. If they thenlead naturally into larger long-term pay-offs, so much the better. But I never have toundergo a long period of stoic self-denial based upon the hope of a brighter futuremany years away.I also take a second look at each activity Ive labeled enjoyment  to be sure Ireally enjoy those things. If Im not very sure, I start looking for better things withwhich to replace them.This technique should raise important questions for you as you appraise themotivations behind each of your activities. The goal is happiness  but its easy to beside-tracked into worthless activities by vague promises of better days to come. Everyday should include genuine enjoyment.The many stories of single-minded success-seekers who patiently climbed to the topmake good reading, but they can overlook a lot of relevant details. Often, the prize isattained when the winner is too old to enjoy it fully. In reality, I think that success is moreoften achieved by individuals who found ways of enjoying themselves while in theprocess of getting where they wanted to go.LabelsIf you use these four techniques, you might wind up with a page full of labels. Itmay seem very mechanical, but it will help to demonstrate how much of your life can bewasted in purposeless activity. If you wonder why you arent free, a few hours spentwith these techniques may provide the answer.Each of the four techniques can be utilized within subdivisions of your life, suchas your work. By reviewing each hour of your typical work week, you can determinehow much of your time is spent in ways of your choosing, how much is actuallycontributing to your income, how much you enjoy your work, and how much yourecontrolling your own career future.Is Your Life What You Want It to Be?243If you manage your own working time, the labels can inspire you to make changesthat will increase the productivity and enjoyment in your work. If you dont manageyour working time, the labels can tell you whether or not your work is valuable toyou. If your job is one in which youre just there for forty hours each week to dowhatever youre told, dont waste too much time with these techniques  use thetime to look for another job.Ive never been much for taking notes and writing things down. So I canunderstand if you think that making a list of your activities is too much work. If thatsthe case, you can still use the technique by mentally labeling each thing as you do it.After a day or two, it might become habitual to identify each activity and evaluate it.Id still like to urge you to write out the list, however. Only in that way can yousee at a glance your total situation and make a realistic appraisal of your activities.The use of these techniques can dramatically increase your self-control, self-confidence, and happiness. They will provide an answer to the important question:How many hours a week are you happy?Its very easy to pay more attention to the lives of others, to complain about thestate of the world and the mistakes of others, and to ignore ones own self-defeatinghabits. Without realizing it, you can spend most of your time doing things thatcontribute nothing to your happiness  and that actually perpetuate the conditionsthat make you unfree and unhappy.Dont be too anxious to justify your activities as being necessary to long-termgoals. The future has an annoying habit of forgetting its appointments  or arriving toolate for them.Ive always found it hard to understand why so many people live so much forthe future  especially when the present is such a lovely place.SimplicityThe primary value of these techniques is to simplify your life, to help you get ridof the vague, complicated activities that contribute nothing positive.Arrange your life so that you dont have to spend every waking hour carrying outobligations, holding things together, trying not to rock the boat.Make sure that every week has a specified time thats totally unplanned. Reservethat time so that you can decide  when it arrives  how youll use it. Dont use itto catch up on unfinished business; use it to enjoy yourself, to do what you want mostto do at that moment.244Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldWhen youve accomplished that, arrange things so that every day has such a periodof unplanned time. Make your life meaningful and tasty by enjoying happiness everyday.Youll have to make some long-term plans, of course. But periodically reappraiseyour routine to be sure those plans are still leading you toward rewarding goals.Ive been told so many times that freedom is just a fantasy, that you cant live thatway in the real world, that there are too many daily commitments that have to be met,that in real life things are much too complicated to be able to do what you want andto enjoy yourself.But who made your life complicated?You did, of course. It wasnt society, the economic system, the people youconsider to be nuisances, your parents, or anyone else.Every complication in your life today is the result of something youve allowed tohappen. You initiated it, or you consented to it, or youve allowed it to continue.You are where you are today because youve chosen to be there. Andyou can choose not to be there.Youll have to pay for past mistakes, but no mistake warrants a life sentence. You cantelescope those payments into the short term and get rid of them quickly.You can get rid of bad relationships, meaningless obligations, negativecommitments. You can do anything you want. Youre free  if only youll realize it.Only you can choose to make things better for yourself. You can decideto stop going along with things that are handed to you. You can decideto live your life as the free person you are.Dont tell me that it cant be done. There are too many people whove alreadydone it.No matter where you are now, you can unravel all the knots that youve woveninto your life.You can decide to be free. No one else has to be convinced  it requires onlyyour decision and action.Is Your Life What You Want It to Be?24530A Fresh StartNow its time to put many ideas together to create a practical plan with whichyou can transform your life from what it is to what you want it to be.To do this in my own life, Ive used a technique I call Starting From Zero. Itspurpose is to clear your mind of the boxes, complications, and obligations that may begetting in the way of what you want to do.The technique utilizes many of the ideas weve discussed already; its a way of tyingtogether everything weve seen. It has many uses  but its greatest value can be thecreation of a new, freer life. It focuses attention on what you want and keeps youaimed toward it.Even with the labeling techniques we saw in the last chapter, its too easy torationalize every part of your present existence as being necessary  if you use it as thestarting point. So its important to clear your mind of all present commitments; onlythen can you get a clear view of what you really need to be happy.The starting-from-zero technique uses the life you dream of as the standard andcompares everything with it, eliminating anything in your present routine that isntpart of the dream life. It provides the simplest way to determine which parts of yourpresent life arent what you really want  and to be able to visualize a way of gettingto where you want to be.There are seven steps in the technique:1. Mentally step outside your present way of life. Start from zero by imaginingyourself outside of your present routine. Expand upon the daydreams youve hadbefore  imagine now that youre no longer entangled in any of your presentresponsibilities, obligations, or relationships. Envision yourself totally on your own with none of your present possessions, family, career, social commitments, debts, orcontracts.In other words, youre completely free  starting from zero with a clean slate, afresh start to go in any direction that you choose. Dont concern yourself now withthe restrictions that presently exist in your life; dont even try to decide how youllremove them. Just imagine that theres no one to restrict you or make any claims uponyou.2462. What would you do? Ask yourself what youd do with this totally freesituation.Where would you go? What would you like to do for a living? What have youalways wanted to do thats been prevented by your old way of life? Whom would youlike to see? What would you do with your time?In this new life, would you be single? Would you want to live with the person youvealways desired? Would you want a particular kind of home? What kind of work wouldyou like to pursue? What material things would give you pleasure?Only one restriction should be imposed upon your dreams: You cant makesomeone else be what you want him to be. It serves no purpose to imagine that yourspouse has suddenly changed as youve wanted him to, or that your boss has finallygiven you that raise. Nor does it serve any purpose to dream that youre married toSophia Loren.However, you can dream that youre free to pursue Sophia Loren, and to applyyour best efforts to the task of winning her love. In the same way, you can imaginethat youre free to pursue any career you desire  but not to imagine that others willmiraculously throw money at you in contradiction with their own natures.But there are no other restrictions to prevent you from trying anything you want.So include in your fantasy anything you think youd truly enjoy. Include parts of yourpresent life  if theyre sources of genuine pleasure to you. But dont includesomething simply because it seems necessary or irremovable.Dont restrain your fantasies. Picture yourself actually doing the things involved.Act them out in your mind. See if theyre really what you want for yourself.After youve done this for a few days, your dream will begin to have moresubstance. Youll have a good idea what kind of work youd like to try, where youdlike to go, who youd like to be with, what would give you real pleasure. As youcontinue thinking about it, however, you might alter parts of the dream as other tastyideas occur to you.Do this for a couple of weeks  longer, if necessary. Continue building thedream until you no longer think of ways to improve upon it. Until then, retreat to yourdream world every chance you get. Think about it, indulge it, live it mentally, changeit, refine it, develop it. Get into the details of it so that you can see more clearly whatyoud most enjoy.After a while, the various fantasies should begin to settle into one basic dream. Atthat point, it would be very helpful to make a list of the elements in the ideal life youvepictured. Write down everything that occurs to you about it  the material thingsyou want, the occupation, the new relationships, where youA Fresh Start247want to live, etc. It may take a couple of days to recall everything youve thought of thatyou want to be a part of your new life.By writing down the elements of the dream, you can focus upon them more clearly and make better use of the next step.3. What is your present life like? Now take a close look at your present routine.What activities engage you now? What is your work? How do you spend your time?Whom are you required to associate with? Where does your money go? List theactivities in your present life  if you havent already compiled a list for thetechniques mentioned in the last chapter.4. Cross off everything in your present life that doesnt appear in your dreamlife. If theres something in your present life that isnt part of the life you want foryourself, theres no reason to perpetuate it. All you need to find is a way out of it  andwere coming to that.You might find that youll cross off everything from your present life  that yourenot doing anything now that conforms with your dream of an ideal life. If so, dont bediscouraged by that discovery. Everything you cross off from your present life can bereplaced with something new, something better, something more productive ofhappiness.Financing the New LifeThe next part deals with the means of financing your new life.5. What do you need to make your dream life possible? Estimate therequirements and costs of your imagined new life. How much time would benecessary to ready yourself for the profession you have in mind? How much moneywould you need to go where you want to be? How much time is required for theactivities you crave? What other resources are necessary for the kind of existenceyoure dreaming of?For the moment, dont worry about what you already have or how youll getwhat you need; just determine the costs required. How much money would you need?How much time? Your knowledge will go with you anywhere  but you need toestimate the cost of adding any extra knowledge you might need to achieve yourends.6. What are your present assets and liabilities? Set aside your dream world longenough to make an inventory of your present financial situation.What are your present assets? How much money can you freely spend as you choose?What is the worth of your present property (home, land, furniture, savings, car,appliances, investments)?Now list your present liabilities. How much money do you owe? What othermonetary obligations have you incurred  family support, leases, business248Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldliabilities, charitable pledges? Make your list complete; you need to know exactly whereyou stand. Dont overlook any liabilities  you cant eliminate them until yourecognize them.If your assets are greater than your liabilities, the difference is your usable networth  what you have available to meet the requirements of your new life.If your net worth is very small  or even if your liabilities are greater than yourassets  dont let that stop you. Dont decide that you cant make any changes untilyoure out of debt. The situation isnt likely to get any better as long as you continueyour present way of life.Losing businesses have been perpetuated for years in hopes that a few more saleswould make them profitable. And in the same way, many hopeless routines are continuedin the vain hope that things will be better tomorrow. Things will get better only whenyou make the changes that are necessary to make them better.Its your present way of life thats piled debts and obligations on your shoulders.If you continue it, your debts will more likely increase. Its important to get to zero to a free position  as soon as possible so that you can have a clean start to movein the direction you want to go. When you escape from your boxes, youll have theopportunity to increase your net worth  if thats what you want.In addition to monetary responsibilities, inventory your other commitments. Areyou obligated to future social responsibilities? Are you married? Do you havechildren? What other commitments do you have?Any burdensome commitments can be eliminated by paying some price; you can clearthem with an expenditure of time or money. Add the monetary prices of eliminatingunwanted commitments to your financial liabilities so that you can pay them off andbe done with them.And now we come to the best part:7. Make changes. Eliminate present assets that arent on your dream list. Turninto cash all the material possessions that arent necessary to your dream life.Eliminate all the activities that consume time without contributing to the existenceyou really want.Use the cash proceeds to pay off your liabilities. Try to eliminate everycommitment in that way. If you wind up with nothing but a free life, youll be wayahead. With a free life, you can acquire what you want much more easily, with nodebts or obligations to eat up the money as you make it.If you have cash left over after paying off the liabilities, use it to finance thoseparts of the dream world that require money. And use the time you save to indulgeyourself in the dream activities youve previously denied yourself.A Fresh Start249You should be able to create a workable plan on paper. Youll be able to see whatcan be eliminated, and how the proceeds in time and money can be used to pay offliabilities and buy the things you want.But sometimes these matters are so complicated that it seems impossible to workthem out on paper. If thats the case, the best alternative is to actually liquidate yourpresent holdings. Sell everything  terminate all relationships, contracts, plans,programs. Sell all your property  whether or not any part of it is on your dream list and pay off all your debts as far as the money will go.Thats a drastic step  and I dont advise it unless you absolutely cant work outa transition on paper. But if thats whats necessary, do it. When youve done it, youllbe free to move in any direction you want.Dont be afraid to give up anything thats part of a basically unfree life. Anythingyou cherish can probably be reacquired later without any of the problems involvednow. The important thing is to be free  and that may require a clean sweep.Temporary MeasuresPart of your dream life may involve a period of time necessary to establish a newcareer or relationship, and it may be that you have nothing in reserve to finance sucha period. If so, you might need to take an intermediate job or find an intermediaterelationship to tide you over.Be careful, however. Too often, temporary expedients turn into permanent ruts.Some of your present life may have been undertaken originally as a short term meansto an end that never materialized.You might decide that your present job is suitable for your new life. Or there might berelationships you want to keep. If so, examine those things cautiously. Theyre part ofyour present situation  and they may be contributing to the rut from which youretrying to free yourself.If you keep your present job to tide you over, use a miniature starting-from zerotechnique to determine the absolute minimum you must contribute to it in order to beworth what you receive from it. Do what is necessary for you to be worth yourincome, but eliminate all other activities from your working routine  such assocializing, long-term investments in a distant promotion or increased skill, extrahours worked without pay, etc. Earn what youre paid but do nothing beyond that.In the same way, apply the starting-from-zero technique to any relationships youintend to keep. Dont start by considering what you do now to preserve suchrelationships. Instead, start from zero by determining what you truly need and wantfrom the relationship, then determine whats necessary to make that possible, andeliminate from your present activities anything that exceeds that.250Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldYou dont have to call friends daily or weekly to keep their friendship, nor do youhave to visit your parents weekly to retain them as your parents.Be HonestWhile youre in the process of thinking out these matters, someone may confront youwith a question that seems to require a decision by you.For example, while youre considering your career plans, your employer mightwant to discuss a new position for you or a relocation to another city. Or while yourethinking about your marriage, your spouse might ask a question that indirectly concernsthe future of your marriage (such as if you want to buy the new home youvediscussed).Dont allow such questions to pressure you into making a premature longtermdecision. You dont have to sever the relationship on the spot; neither do you have toaccept the new commitment, resign yourself to staying, and then pretend you had nothought of leaving.The safest way to handle such a question is by being totally honest. And what isyour honest position? Its probably that you dont know the answer  that youre inthe process of re-examining your entire life, and that youre not sure yet whatanswers youll find.The person involved might be shocked to learn that youre even consideringrocking the boat. He may accuse you of being selfish, thoughtless, disloyal, orirresponsible for suggesting that you might put your own life ahead of yourrelationships with other people.But you know that you arent going to be irresponsible. Youre facing yourobligations and commitments  and youre considering what might be done toimprove upon them.As to your selfishness, of course youre going to put your own life first  asanyone with any sense would do  as each person is doing, each in his own way.And its up to you to determine your way  regardless of structures, institutions,social pressures, moral codes, or relationships.Its easy to be thrown off balance by a question for which you have no immediateanswer. What are the poor children going to do? Wont this break your sickmothers heart? How are you going to satisfy your financial commitments? etc.Dont give up your dreams just because you cant answer every question yet. Theonly honest answer is that youre considering such matters now and you haventresolved them yet. If youre not allowed to consider such things for yourself, youmust be a slave.A Fresh Start251If the person involved is reasonable and willing to discuss the matter with you, somuch the better. His attitude may be helpful in discovering the price you might have topay to eliminate a commitment to him.Its also possible that someone will react negatively at first, but then become moreagreeable when hes had time to think of the possible benefits to himself.No matter what the reaction, I think the safest approach is to be honest in tellingexactly where you stand  even if you stand at that moment in a state of indecision.The Big DecisionThroughout this book, weve considered many possibilities and alternatives thatcan enable you to live a freer life. Now weve finally come to the important question:What do you do about it?The only sensible answer is to eliminate from your life whatever isnt suited toyou, acquire the freedom youve craved, and start living your life as you want to liveit.The starting-from-zero technique is an essential means of getting from here tothere. If you use your present life as the starting point, you have very little chance ofgetting what you want; you can find too many justifications for hanging on to eachpart of your present routine.You have to go back to zero and start there, asking yourself what youd do if youwerent involved as you are now. Only in that way can you see a clear, realisticpicture of the life that would make you happy. Then you can determine the relevanceof each of your present activities.Once you know what is necessary to live the kind of life you want, bold action isrequired. Take your time thinking about these matters, but dont be slow in acting onthem  once youve thought things out.There may be other ways to be free, but Ive never come across any that work.Ive seen friends use various kinds of gradualism in their approaches, but years laterthey were still in the same boxes.252Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldFreedom requires bold action. You may make mistakes in the process  and youmay lose some of what you have  but anything you lose can be reacquired onceyoure free.You dont have to remain in boxes. Its your choice. You can be free.The worst thing one can do is not to try, to be aware of what onewants and not give in to it, to spend years in silent hurt wondering ifsomething could have materialized  and never knowing. David S. ViscottThere is a tide in the affairs of men,Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound inshallows and in miseries.A Fresh Start253 Shakespeare31A Fresh Start (Continued)The starting from zero technique can be used on a smaller scale to straighten outproblems in any specific area of your life.Ive mentioned before the way I changed a business from an employeeemployerstructure to the use of independent contractors. The employees and myself all benefitedfrom the tax advantages, the free time provided, and the lesser amount of supervisionrequired.This plan came about as a result of using the starting-from-zero technique. Thebusiness was operating at a loss and seemed hopeless. Every time I tried to cut costs, I gotnowhere  every expense seemed to be a necessity.Finally, I cleared my mind of all preconceived notions and current arrangements. Itook as the only given premise the amount of money the company received each month.Then I imagined what it would be like if we had to do nothing to receive that money.Naturally, we couldnt continue receiving the income without providing something forit. So I listed the functions that would be absolutely necessary in order to maintain theincome  without considering the existing expenses.I didnt list employees or facilities necessary  only functions. If I thought of afunction and then decided the income could continue without it, I didnt add it to the list.When the list was completed, I could see that there were many functions Id beentaking for granted that didnt show up on the list.Instead of assigning the necessary functions to employees, I asked for bids fromthe marketplace  inviting employees and outside businesses to submit prices forperforming the necessary functions. The resulting costs were far less than theprevious expenses.The employees who continued to work with me became independent contractors.They performed specific services  in their own ways and at their own speeds  forwhich they were paid a specific fee for each service. Rules were set only for the qualityof the service and the delivery deadlines.The new system changed the business into a profitable venture and made the workmore profitable and enjoyable for every individual concerned. But I wouldnt havecome to the system without using the starting-from-zero254technique to eliminate all my preconceived notions regarding the expenses that werenecessary.That same technique can be used in any area of your life that requires changingbut that seems too complicated to straighten out. Begin by imagining what it is youwant  and then determine the minimum necessary to get it. Then compare that withwhat youre already doing and eliminate everything currently done that isnt part ofthe new system.Liquidation ProceduresIve suggested that all relationships (marriage, business, friendships) will be morevaluable if arranged so the individual sovereignty of each participant is maintainedand respected. Each piece of property should be owned by one person whosresponsible for it and has total control over it. Each decision should be the provinceof only one person.Unfortunately, marriages and businesses are normally arranged with communalownership as the rule, so it may seem that my suggestion has come too late. But thereare ways of unraveling any financial entanglements.Here are three methods that can be used  either to convert an existingrelationship to individual ownership, or to liquidate a relationship in which property isowned by more than one person.The first method is the simplest. Sell everything thats jointly owned and split thecash proceeds according to the division of ownership. If the property was owned 50-50, split the cash 50-50. If several people have varying percentages of ownership, splitthe cash accordingly.The drawback to this method is the reluctance to sell things you might want tokeep. Youd have to sell them at wholesale and then use your share of the proceedsto buy back what you want at retail.So lets move onto the second method. This one will work only when there aretwo participants and the ownership is divided 50-50. The object is to find a way todivide the property in such a way that neither party feels hes received the least valuablepart of the split.To avoid that, use an old trick. One person divides the property into what heconsiders to be two equal shares. Then the other person chooses which of the twoparts he wants.The second person cant complain that the split was unequal, for he had theprivilege of choosing the best share. And the first person cant complain, for he wasable to decide how the property would be split.A variation of this method has been written into many business partnershipcontracts. The contract specifies that either partner can offer to buy out the otherA Fresh Start (continued)255at any time  specifying the price hes willing to pay. The other partner must eitheraccept the offer or buy out the first partner at the same price. In other words, onepartner determines the price; the other then chooses whether hell buy or sell at thatprice. Neither can complain that the price was unfair.As you know, I dont think much of partnerships; there are much better ways ofhandling business arrangements. But if you ever decide you must form a partnership, Iurge you to include that provision in the contract  no matter how sure you are thattherell never be any problems with your partner.A Better WayTheres a third method for dividing property thats the best way I know of. It wasdevised by a man named Wilmot Hunter. It will work no matter how many people areinvolved  and no matter what the divisions of ownership may be. It can be used inmarriages, businesses, or any other type of relationship.Lets use a marriage as an example. Suppose you and your spouse decide toconvert your joint holdings to individual ownership. You may not be planning adivorce; it may be only that you agree with the principles of individual sovereigntyexpressed in Chapter 19 and want to implement them.At first glance, it might seem to be a horrendous task. How are you going todivide equally such diverse items as the coffee table, the record collection, and thegardening tools? But it really isnt difficult at all.The answer is to hold an auction  an auction at which the two of you will bidagainst each other for the property thats been jointly owned.First, eliminate from the auction any property or money thats already individuallyowned by either of you. You can also eliminate any personal items such as clothes,cosmetics, etc.  if both of you agree to it. Then split whatever money you have injoint savings or checking accounts.Now place each item of jointly owned property on the auction block  one at atime. Each of you can bid as much money for each item as you think its worth toyou. The highest bidder for each item gets it  and he then owes that amount ofmoney to the proceeds.When all the items have been auctioned, each thing will be owned by one personor the other. Total the winning bids to determine the proceeds of the auction and splitthat amount between the two of you  each of whom will use his share to pay off hiswinning bids.If your winning bids exceed your share of the proceeds, youll need to use yourshare of the cash that was split before the auction. Youll have to keep track of your bidsand the proceeds as you go along  to be sure youre not bidding more than you canafford.256Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf there are so many small items that it would seem to take forever to auction themindividually, you can group them to be auctioned as sets. That should only be done if bothparties consent to it, however; if theres any disagreement over the handling of any item, itshould go on the auction block by itself.No one will get an item too cheaply just because its of more value to him thanthe other person. Theres always a market price  a price at which you can bid forthe item, knowing you can sell it for more than that elsewhere. So no one is likely toobtain anything for less than what the other person considers to be a fair price.If you arent overly fond of some of your present property, you can invite othersto attend the auction and bid. That should increase the proceeds, resulting in morecash for yourselves. It should be done only if both of you agree, however.In a marriage, the normal division of proceeds is 50-50. But this plan can be usedno matter how many people are involved  and no matter what the shares ofownership may be.Suppose there are four partners liquidating a business. Lets say they havedifferent-sized shares in the business  40, 30, 20, and 10 percent respectively. Theycould argue forever over the way the property should be divided fairly.Using the auction method, they can eliminate all the bitterness. After the auction,the proceeds are split according to the percentages of the business each one owns.In any kind of arrangement, no one can complain afterward that he was cheatedby the auction. If anyone thinks that someone else is getting an item too cheaply, allhe has to do is to bid more for it.No one will be limited to bidding only his anticipated proceeds. Anyone can bid toobtain more than his share of the property  as long as he has the cash, or canborrow it, to cover his purchases.This is a simple, clean way of untangling complicated affairs. Theres no bitteraftermath; everyone can part friends without the recriminations and accusations thatusually accompany property settlements.A Fresh StartThe techniques for getting out of boxes are by no means limited to those Ivesuggested in this book. More than anything else, my purpose has been to demonstratethat theres always a way out. Never feel that your life is frozen in its present routineand that its hopeless to want anything better.No matter how complicated your life has become, theres a way tounravel it. No matter how many boxes you may be in, theresA Fresh Start (continued)257always a way to pay a price and get out. No matter how alienated youmay feel in your environment, theres always a way to find morecompatible people.You have only one life. If you resign yourself to living it in a hopelesssituation, youre creating for yourself the greatest possible tragedy.If thats what you do, it will be you who have caused it. What others want anddemand is only their concern. What you choose to do will be your responsibility.You have so much control in your hands. Why use it foolishly? Why notexercise the power you hold? Why not use it to make your life what youwant it to be?Why not get out of the boxes, the complications, the entanglements, theobligations?Why not be free?For of all sad words of tongue or pen,The saddest are these: It might have been! John Greenleaf Whittier258Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World32Making ChangesThe seventh step of the starting-from-zero technique is to make changes to bringabout the life you desire. At that point, however, the changes may seem too difficult tocarry out. You might be expecting strong opposition from the other people involved,and you may wonder how youll ever get through the problems you face.It will probably seem less difficult if you first think through the entire situationyou face. If you do, you may find that theres nothing involved that you cant handle.Lets go through it together. As you read this chapter, Id like you to keep in mind themost important change you believe you should make. It may have to do with your job,your marriage, an important relationship. Whatever it is, everything Im about to saywill be directed at that change.PricesThere will be a price to pay, of course; any major change is bound to include one. Theprice may be in emotional upheaval, the admission of a mistake, the paying of a debtyou havent wanted to acknowledge, the loss of money or property youve thoughtwas yours.Whatever the price, identify it now. What will you have to go through to getwhere you want to be? The nice part of it is that there is a price you can pay to be freeof the situation once and for all. It may be a fantastic price or a tiny one  but thereis a price.To find out what it is, determine whos involved. Who will you have to deal with?What will those people want? What have you told them they can expect? Maybe youknow those people well enough to be able to estimate already what you must pay.As you think about the price, its important to decide how much youre willing topay to be rid of the box. Theres a point beyond which it would no longer be worth itto you to make the change. Decide now what that point is.If its a business arrangement, would you be willing to give up everything youvecreated to start over again  taking only your talent and knowledge with259you? To be able to use them freely may be worth more in the long run than anythingyou might have to leave behind.If its a marriage, would you be willing to give up all the property, custody of thechildren, everything you own  if you have to? Determine now at what point its notworth it to you to change.Whatever you do, dont evade the price. Face up to everything thats involved. Toignore the price will only make it that much more difficult to handle when the timecomes. As you think about this, recognize any commitments youve made. Dont tryto avoid responsibilities youve accepted. Each of them represents a price to be paid,and only when youve paid those prices can you be free.Negotiate them if you can; maybe they can be minimized. But dont expect toavoid them entirely; if you do, youll probably end up paying a higher price than youneeded to.If youve agreed to perform a certain job, talk to the person with whom you madethe agreement. Maybe its no longer important to him that you go through with it. Butif hes counting on your work, deliver.You might be able to subcontract the work to someone else  so that your timewill be free. Even if the subcontracting would cost you more than youll receive fromthe job, it might still be profitable to do it. The extra money you pay out of your pocketmight be a small price to pay for your freedom.In fact, you might be able to make more money doing something else with thattime. If so, youre better off taking a loss on the original job by subcontracting it.Never be afraid to take a loss on a specific transaction; it will often help you to makemore elsewhere.The same principles apply to any other commitments youve made. Recognizethem as prices to be paid in time or money for past mistakes. Often, however, youcan negotiate a way of paying the price that is less expensive to you and just assatisfactory to the other person. Try to be imaginative in thinking of other alternativesthat might work better for everyone concerned.Dont Be SidetrackedIf youre dealing with someone who wants to punish you or make you paydearly for your selfishness, dont let it throw you. Understand that an emotionallydistraught person might try every trick he can think of to make you feel guilty moral recriminations, sympathy-seeking, we need you statements.Dont get sidetracked trying to justify yourself or to prove someone else wrong. Ifhe wants to teach you a lesson to satisfy his pride, let him.260Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldDont get caught in the Whos right? game. Each of you in the situation hasmade at least one mistake or you wouldnt be involved now. Maybe you think hismistakes were worse than yours. So what? Is proving that more important thanyour freedom?No matter whos at fault, recognize that you have mistakes of your own youllhave to pay for. Concern yourself with those prices; the other person will have to payfor his own mistakes in some other way. Dont make that your business; it will onlytie you up further.Be concerned with your commitments and try to satisfy them as soon as possible,The only commitments that cant be taken seriously are lifetime promises. Itsunrealistic to promise lifelong love, devotion, loyalty, or presence. Id be willing tobreak such promises. I wouldnt expect to get out without paying a price  myreputation would suffer, for one thing. But theres no reason to give up the oneindispensable element to your happiness (your life) in order to honor a commitment.Obviously, the experience should demonstrate the importance of never again makingsuch promises.When the price is determined, try to pay it in as short a period as possible. Thesooner youve satisfied the obligations, the sooner youll be totally free.If its merely a confrontation you must go through, get it over with as soon aspossible. If it involves money or time, arrange to pay the price in full as soon as youcan.Picture ItOnce you know what the price will be, picture yourself paying that price. Imagineyourself actually doing the things youll have to do to finish this business. If its painful,then do it again. Keep picturing yourself paying the price  the whole scene, every bitof dialogue  over and over again until its no longer painful and terrifying.Recognize everything that might go wrong and imagine yourself dealing with it.What will you say? How will you handle it? How will you respond if someonebecomes hysterical?If you do this, it wont be nearly so difficult to handle when you do it in reality.Your emotions will be calmer, youll think more clearly, youll be prepared forsurprises and less likely to be thrown off balance.It would be foolish to think you can handle in reality what is too painful andterrifying to imagine. So dont be mentally lazy and hope that everything will go well.Dont take the attitude that things will work out or I can handleMaking Changes261whatever develops. Positive thinking wont get you through this; only realisticpreparation will.ChildrenOne of the prices may involve children. If you have children now, ask yourself ifthey were in the dream world you imagined when starting from zero. If not, youarent likely to help them or yourself by taking them with you into your new life.Children belong where theyre really wanted, not where theyre a burden. Youdont do anyone a favor when you give up your happiness for him; that can lead tooeasily to a load of guilt for the beneficiary. You cant hide your sacrifice forever, and itcan have very bad consequences when its discovered.Let the child be raised by someone who wants him dearly and who can give himgenuine love and affection. Such things are vital to a child and they cant be faked.If you choose to give up your children  either to your spouse or for adoption youll probably be condemned by some of the people around you now. But in yournew life, those people may no longer be around you.That wont eliminate all the prices, however. You may be required to support thechild financially. Recognize that and determine how you can pay it with a minimum ofdiscomfort to yourself.Also, the price may be in disapproval from new friends when they learn whatyouve done. Recognize that now, too. How will that affect you? Imagine thedisapproval and determine how youll handle it.Another form of the price may be a meeting with your child someday in thefuture. He may resent what youve done. Be sure you can handle that when ithappens. Are you really sure youre doing the right thing? Can you explain it?Facing the ConsequencesRecognize all these possibilities now; dont ignore them and think you can handlethem later. You have to know what youre doing  and why  and what theconsequences will be. You cant be free by acting on a whim or on someones advice;you have to be sure you know what youre doing.Im not presenting these challenges to talk you out of making big changes.Obviously, I believe that bold action is necessary to get out of a gray existence andinto a sunny one. But its essential that you know whats coming before you act.262Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldYou have to be convinced that youre acting in the best way. And that means youmust realistically face up to every negative factor, every price you can think of before you act.When youve done that, you can act boldly, with confidence and conviction.Once you know what youre doing, nothing should be allowed to stand in your way.You can then face the censure that might come from those whod prefer that you stayput and shut up.Withdrawal SymptomsOne of the most important prices to be paid in dissolving a relationship isemotional. If you give up a child, a spouse, a lover, or a friend, youll probably misshim. You might feel the urge to run back to where you were before.These urges are withdrawal symptoms  temporary emotional reactions torelationships youve left. Theyre the emotional equivalents of the reactions you getwhen you give up smoking or some other habit.Its important to recognize now that they will occur. Be prepared for them imagine yourself living through them, cry about them. As with any other price, dontignore them. Dont take the attitude that youll worry about them when they happen.If you face them now, youll be better prepared to deal with them when theyoccur later. You wont be thrown off balance and tempted to run back to your oldway of life, just to eliminate a temporary emotional discomfort.The BenefitsJust as you must be prepared for the negative aspects of your change, keep in mindthe positive benefits that prompted you to make the change.Theres no sure way to keep your emotions under control as you go through thechange. But if you keep reminding yourself of the benefits that await you, it will beeasier.You know why you want this, you know what youll have to go through to getthere, and youve made such decisions at times when your intellect was in control.Dont throw away your future when your emotions become intense.If your emotions urge you to turn back, remind yourself of the important rule dont decide now. Dont make important decisions when your emotions are strong;you cant see all the consequences at such a time. Youll have made your decision at the bestpossible time, when your intellect was in control; dont throw it away when youremotions become intense.Making Changes263The strongest emotional pressure will be encouragement to turn back in order toavoid paying the price. Dont do it. Keep reminding yourself what youre paying for.Remember that you wont make things better by turning back now. Things will neverbe the same as they were once; the only way to better them is to continue forward towhere youve decided to go.Pay the price. Dont be so afraid of sudden, sharp discomfort that you willinglytolerate chronic, continual, deadening pain the rest of your life. If you refuse toundergo temporary discomfort, youre resigning yourself to a lifetime with littlehappiness. The chronic pain can deaden your senses, destroy your love of life, and makeyou bitter.You wont avoid the price by staying where you are. Instead, youll pay it everyday of your life as you stand on the sidelines and watch exciting alternatives pass youby. And the longer you put off the confrontation, the greater the price to be paideventually.The most important thing is to act, to do something to improve your life.From where you stand now, you may be able to see some of the benefits offreedom. But only when you walk through that door will you see all the good thingsthat can be yours on the other side.Even if you cant be sure what awaits you, whats the value in continuing a wrongdecision? Is that all your life is worth?CourageYou may feel that you dont have the courage to make big changes in your life.But courage is too often thought of as blind, thoughtless bravado. It usually isnt.People who seem to act courageously usually have specific consequences inmind; they know the consequences both of acting and not acting. Theyve decidedthat the consequences of not acting are worse than the consequences of what weconsider to be their courageous acts.We dont necessarily know what their motivations are (they might be expectationsof good things to come, fear of being thought a coward, desire for attention, etc.), butthe person acting believes he knows.When youre convinced you know the consequences of either course, youll takeaction. If you have to walk through a dangerous mob to get to safety on the otherside of the street, youll do so only when youre convinced that the consequences ofstanding still are more dangerous than moving. Until then, any talk of bravery ismeaningless.264Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldThats why its important to think things out in advance. Recognize the problemsinvolved and how youll cope with them. And recognize the benefits that await you;focus on them and remember them when things get difficult.Once you can see and almost taste the good consequences of being free, once youknow how to handle the prices youll have to pay to get there, youll be impatient tostart. You wont lack the courage.Certainly there will be many unknowns  and they can be frightening. But theydont have to remain unknowns. Identify the elements that are mysterious to you and thentry to get the information necessary to take the mystery out of them.If someones attitude is an unknown factor, ask him what his attitude is. If anunknown factor is the motivation of someone whos causing problems for you, go tohim and get it out into the open. Find out what hes trying to accomplish. He may notbe articulate enough to explain it, so cultivate the art of asking enough questions to getthe answers you need.Its amazing how many mysteries of life can be dissolved just by asking questions.Dont be afraid to ask questions like How would you feel if I were to make somechanges? Whats the matter with our situation? Are you upset with me? Developthe technique of asking for what you want to know.Often someone will tell you that the answer will depend upon circumstances. Ifso, find out what circumstances. Keep asking until you know what standard hes usingto determine the circumstances.For example, suppose youre considering changing jobs but theres a possibility ofa big raise coming soon  only you dont know when or how big the raise will be.Find out. Keep asking questions until you know what the circumstances must be inorder to get your raise. Do you intend to give me a raise? . . . How much? . . .When? . . . What does it depend upon? . . . What must happen to permit the raise?Have him define such vague terms as substantial raise, increased business,soon, better quality work, etc. Then you can determine if its worth your while towait for it.When you clear up all the mysteries, it will be much easier to act. Youll knowwhy youre acting.The Needs of OthersIts easy to be influenced by the apparent needs of others  your spouse,children, employer, employees, friends, parents, relatives. They may seem to bedependent upon you. What will happen to them if you put your own freedom first?Making Changes265Lets put your imagination to work one more time. This time take a few momentsto imagine that youre going to die tonight. Yes  die. Pretend that youll no longerbe here to satisfy the needs of those who have been your responsibility.After you think about it for a while, youll probably come to a depressingconclusion  somehow, some way, by some miracle, the world will survive withoutyou.Somehow your relatives will find someone else to borrow money from; the churchwill get someone else to arrange the flowers on the altar every Sunday; your friendswill find new people to do favors for them. And your spouse may mourn for a suitableperiod  and then marry your best friend.Your political crusades will succeed or fail  just as they would if you werearound to help. Your club will find someone else to do its fund-raising. And thosewhove leaned so heavily upon you for advice and sympathy will find other shoulders (andprobably follow the new advice as infrequently as they did yours).Im not saying you wont be missed; that isnt the point. The significance is thatthese people will find ways to survive without you. Youre not as indispensable toothers as you may have believed.If they can survive without you, why couldnt you just disappear tonight withouta trace, move a thousand miles away, and have a fresh start in an environment whereno one knows you and depends upon you?But why even do that? You dont have to move away. If others can survive if you died ormoved away, why cant they survive without you while you stay here? Just removeyourself from the relationships and complications that dont add to your well-being.In many ways, youll be giving others their freedom, too. You might be surprisedif you knew the discomforts others are suffering in their relationships with you. If arelationship is wrong for you, you cant possibly give to it everything a willing personwould. Why not get out of the way and let others find better situations, too?Even if they seem content with you, it may be that they, too, are afraid to speakup.You cant know whats best for everyone else. Let nature take itscourse; let each person find his own place in the world  in accordancewith his identity, his resources, and his desires.You cant see inside of someone else. You cant decide whats good orbad for others. You can only decide for yourself.266Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldSurprisesMy own experience illustrates the impossibility of knowing whats good forothers.I tolerated an unhappy marriage for eight years. During the last few years of it, Iknew I was dissatisfied but I wouldnt consider a divorce. My wife appeared to bephysically and mentally helpless without me. I even feared that she might commitsuicide if I left her.When I decided to make the break, she resisted at first  but with much bettercontrol of herself than Id ever seen before. And within two weeks she became a self-sufficient woman  doing many things neither of us had thought she could do.Id stayed with her for years, thinking it would be unfair for me to leave whenshe had so many problems. But guess what her problem was! As soon as I left, therewere no more problems.I never dreamed that could happen. Instead, Id prepared for every dire possibilityI could think of. When it turned out so well, it was a simple matter to adjust to mygood fortune.24Mistaken IdentitiesWhat else might be standing in the way of your making a change? Are youunwilling to give up the things youve acquired?Perhaps those things arent really yours. It may be a case of mistaken identities.Are you free to use them in any way you choose? If not, they arent really yours.If youre concerned about your wealth and property, ask yourself how muchownership you actually have. If you have to compromise your desires, if you cant useyour wealth to live your life as you want to, why hang onto it so intensely?Are you afraid of losing friends? If those people would turn against you becauseyouve done something for yourself, maybe you dont really have their friendship.What would you lose if they turned away from you?If its your parents or children that youre afraid of losing, dont be awed by thepowerful family mystique. Families can be wonderful, but not just because a groupof people happen to be of common blood or merely bear the label family. If arelationship  family or otherwise  isnt what it should be, why perpetuate it? Thelove and closeness you need may be more plentiful elsewhere.Making Changes26724One of the most meaningful compliments Ive ever received came years later when my wifethanked me for making her freedom possible.You cant lose anything that cant be reacquired later, so dont focus onindividuals and things. Recognize what it is you desire from them and consider thatyou may be able to get it more easily and richly elsewhere.In my case, I decided in advance of the divorce what Id be willing to give up to gainmy freedom  everything. I knew that nothing was right the way it was. I had a lovelyhouse, nice furniture, some savings, a pretty wife, a compromise relationship with myparents, and a lovely daughter. But none of them satisfied what I really wanted.When my wife said she wanted it all, including sole access to my daughter, I acceptedthose terms without fighting. I knew I could reacquire everything I really wanted on abetter basis.Ive since acquired far more property than I could have earned where I was. Theintellectual stimulation Id always missed is now mine. I have satisfying relationshipsnow that were out of reach where I was before.My parents acted as you might expect parents to act. At first, they took my wifesside and tried to influence me to turn back. But they soon accepted the situation,acknowledged that Id acted rightly, and are now much better friends than they werebefore.I havent seen my daughter since the divorce, nine years ago, in accordance withthe agreement. But that, too, was a case of mistaken identity. I was fairly close to herand I loved her. But it wasnt possible to have the kind of parent child relationship Ibelieve is right.To keep the marriage intact, I had compromised my own ideas about raisingchildren; I went along with traditions of morality and religion that I didnt reallybelieve. I wasnt being myself; I wasnt giving her the things I have to offer. What Idid give her could have been had from many other men.What she lost by being separated from me has been replaced by someone else.What I lost was something I never really had  the opportunity to raise a child withenthusiasm, genuine rapport and mutual understanding, and the freedom to be the kindof example Id like to set for a child.I wont make those mistakes again. They couldnt be corrected where I waswithout someone having to sacrifice. Now that Im free, I can find the rightrelationships in situations that are appropriate to what I want and need.There were withdrawal symptoms, of course. But I was prepared for them. As itturned out, they were few  probably because I was prepared and because I was toobusy making the most of my new life. All I missed was my daughter. But I couldaccept that temporary sadness and even cry about it  without any temptation toescape the sadness by jumping back into the box.268Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldI was considerate and understanding of others, but I never thought that I shouldforfeit my free future for what others seemed to want. I knew that they would survivewithout me and that it was up to them to determine how.Your ProblemEverything Ive said in this chapter has been intended to help you think through amajor change you may be contemplating. The more youre prepared for what is tocome, the easier it will be for you to act.Recognize what you have to do. Anticipate all the prices and picture yourself payingthem. Be straightforward with everyone concerned. And dont be ashamed of whatyoure doing.Above all, recognize the prices in advance. Dont act whimsically, ignoring theconsequences to come. Be prepared to have some of the unknown factors turn outnegatively  and decide in advance how youll handle them if they do.Expect in advance the disapproval, the emotional difficulty, the withdrawalsymptoms. And savor the good things that your freedom can bring you. Keep them inmind as you act; know why youre taking action.If after thinking about these things you still feel unable to act, ask yourself whatyoud do if you knew you were going to die next year. Once you knew you didnthave time to re-educate everyone and arrange things to everyones satisfaction, whatwould you do?Youd probably realize and accept the fact that someone will have to bedispleased by your actions because you wouldnt have time to satisfy everyone.Youd probably get busy and settle your affairs on some basis in order to have sometime left to live as you want to. You wouldnt let anything prevent you from beingfree to enjoy the time left.Well, face it: You are going to die.Youre not going to live forever. You may live for decades or you may die in anaccident tomorrow. But you are going to die someday. Are you going to wait untilthe last moment before you start living for yourself? You dont even know when thelast moment will be.Making Changes269What could be more important than getting a clean start right now so you cansatisfy your dreams before its too late?Theyre your dreams; its your life. No one else is going to make thingsright for you. Only your actions can provide the kind of life you want.Your time has finally come. Make the most of it.The first step is the hardest. Marie de Vichy-ChamrondCertainly, if your spouse truly cannot change . . . he is entitled to beloved by someone for being the way he is. And, do you know,somewhere out in the world there is someone who can love him justthe way he is, who can accept the shortcomings that you can not, whocan appreciate things you dont even notice. What right have you tohold on to someone only to curse the dark side of his personality? David S. ViscottThe ultimate result of shielding men from the effects of folly is to fillthe world with fools. Herbert SpencerHe who hesitates is bossed.270Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World David SeaburyEpilogue27133Freedom in an Unfree WorldWeve come a long way, you and I, since we started in the first chapter. Wevecovered a great many matters and discussed a great many questions that affect yourlife.It doesnt matter whether youve agreed with everything Ive said  or even a largepart of it. My main objective has been to get you thinking about yourself, to open upnew avenues of freedom for you, to help you think of ways to use direct alternatives tobuild a better life for yourself.The important thing is that you take yourself more seriously, that you respect yourown view of the world and make sure that it really is your view, not somethingyouve been told.What Ive said should never be considered to be the final answers to any of thequestions raised  not even by me. For Im growing daily. Today, I understand moreabout life and myself and my ways of living than I did when I began to write thisbook. Theres no way that anything I write could be guaranteed to be my last wordson the subject.But that doesnt alter the usefulness of the ideas. What I say is a means ofstimulating you to find ideas and rules for yourself  rules you can live by becausethey come from you. So whether you agree or disagree is unimportant. Its evenunimportant if Ive changed my mind about some point in the book since I wrote it.I dont expect you to live by my code  anymore than I would live by someoneelses code. I only hope you can find a way of life that fits your unique nature, one thatwill bring you the freedom and happiness that life has to offer.Your life belongs wholly to you. Make it what you think it should be. Trustyourself. For you, your views are far more important than mine.More than anything else, Ive wanted to demonstrate that freedom is possible,that you can live your life as you want to live it  right here and now, without havingto change the world. That may have seemed impossible when you first picked up thisbook; I hope it seems much more realistic now. And as you set to work at the task,the benefits you receive should make it seem even more realistic.272My FreedomIn my own case, Ive had several restrictions to eliminate in order to makefreedom a reality.The first was an uncomfortable marriage. But when I broke free of that, it becameobvious to me that there were no restrictions that couldnt be surmounted.The next restrictions to conquer were mostly philosophical. I had always thoughthighly of my own mind, but I too often ignored conclusions Id reached. And it wastoo easy to submerge my own nature in an attempt to conform to whateverphilosophical or intellectual set I found myself in.Gradually, however, I discovered the benefits of acting upon my own ideas anddesires. I stopped trying to enjoy the way of life I should live  and found ways to liveas I wanted to live.A big philosophical breakthrough for me was the realization that my own freedomwas not only possible, but far more important than the establishment of a free society. Icame to see how foolish it was to waste my precious life trying to make the world intowhat Id thought it should be. I had always been intuitively partial toward directalternatives, but now I was determined to build my whole life upon them.The next step created a way of earning the money I wanted without being a slaveto the treadmill. I never actually had that objective in mind, but the simple applicationof the principles Ive expressed in this book brought it about.Finally, the integration of all these principles into a single philosophy has made itpossible for me to enjoy the blessings of freedom in all areas of my life. It has helpedme understand myself, to understand those I deal with, to find valuable friendships, tounderstand what I crave in romantic relationships and to find that, and to keep myselfout of boxes without any longer having to make a conscious effort to do so.Now freedom lets me enjoy each day as a new opportunity to discover new waysto taste life. Although I make more money than ever before, my work commitmentsare very few and always for brief periods. Most of each year is a free period in which Ican pursue whatever I want.My relationships with friends are on a very positive basis. They include noobligations, no duties, no claims to be presented for payment. Ive learned how to sayno and Ive learned how to make it easy for others to say no to me when thatswhat they want to do.When the telephone rings, I never have to fear that it represents a new burden Imust cope with. Instead, the ringing of the telephone means a new opportunity that Ican accept or turn down as I choose.Freedom in an Unfree World273In the years since my divorce in 1964, Ive enjoyed relationships with wonderfulwomen who have added to my life. None of those situations has evolved into alifetime relationship  but none of them had to in order to be of value. Each hasprovided a positive benefit, filling me with rich emotions and a sense of excitementabout life.Each relationship has been better than any before it because Ive continued tolearn more about what I need in order to be happy, and because Ive continued to learnhow to emphasize the positive benefits in each one.In every area of my life, freedom has been to me like the sunshine  dispelling thegray shadows and spotlighting the beauties that life has to offer.I dont believe Ill ever be 100% free or 100% happy or 100% knowledgeable. Butthat isnt necessary; life is a joyous experience as it is. Each new discovery and each newfreedom brings its own rewards; theres no all-or nothing reward way out in thedistance that must be reached to justify the quest.There are occasional moments of sadness or pain, but theyre always short lived.No setback can destroy me; there are too many good things in life  when one is deniedto me, I have many other opportunities.There are so many wonderful things to enjoy  good music, good food, goodcompanionship, new discoveries, intellectual stimulation, challenging monetaryopportunities. Ive enjoyed too many of them to be willing to give them up for a fruitlesscrusade to change the world or any part of it.Your FreedomMy way of life may be very different from what you want for yourself. So dontjudge the value of freedom by what Ive done with mine. Use the tremendous poweryou have to make your life what you dream it can be.The examples Ive used throughout the book were given to demonstrate thatthere are many practical ways by which you can improve your life and removerestrictions. They were never meant to suggest that you should do the same things Ihave done.In the same way, the suggestions made were designed to show you that theresalways a way  as long as youre not looking for ways to change others. If Ive writtenwith passion and urgency, its because the ideas were important to me. You will have todecide whats important to you.You may have wished that some of the ideas were covered in more detail; theremay have been questions raised in your mind for which you wanted answers. Let thatbe the stimulus for you to investigate and come up with answers that are suitable foryou.274Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldIf youre determined to make things better, youll probably find the answers youneed. If one doesnt work, look for another. The problem for most people is that theywish things were better, but theyre not determined to make them so.The important thing is to concentrate upon what you can do  by yourself, uponyour own initiative, without having to convince others of the rightness of your ideas.Thats the common thread that unites all my suggestions; they are direct alternatives none of them involves changing, educating, or forcing anyone to do what you want.This is by far the easiest way to gain your freedom. Its always much, much harder totry to make other people do what you want them to do.Increasing RewardsThere are rewards every step of the way. First, you can use direct alternatives toeliminate any restrictions that might have caused you to read this book. As you enjoy thebenefits of that newly won freedom, you can apply the principles to broader areas ofyour life  to open up new hours, days, and opportunities for positive experiences.Along the way, the sense of your own sovereignty will probably become more andmore real to you. Its easy to accept intellectually that you make your own decisionsand can choose to do what you want with your life. But emotionally you can find thathard to live by.Slowly but inexorably, however, this realization that you are the ruler of your ownuniverse should become more vivid on new and deeper levels of your attitude. As thathappens, youll become more aware of your own power; youll know that you canhandle anything that comes. And youll know that theres no reason to accept conceptsand relationships that dont offer you what you want.The rewards will be magnified as your sense of sovereignty underlies your way oflife. Youll automatically avoid boxes and traps, youll be ever alert for opportunitiesand new ways to experience happiness.And youll probably realize more deeply that you never need to change other people;youll know that there are always easier ways to have what you want. And thats agreater reward than what you get from removing any single restriction from your life.Im sure that many people accept the abstract principle that you shouldnt try tochange others or interfere with their lives. And yet the principle is rarely applied inpractice.An individual might say, I dont want to change anyone. And yet, he might stillspend a great deal of his time trying to get others to agree with his views, or trying toprevent someone from doing something he thinks will be badFreedom in an Unfree World275for him, or trying to change people by participating in a movement over a burningissue, or voting to prevent others from doing what they want to do. In all these ways, hestrying to change others  to make them do other than what their natures lead them to do.And he doesnt have to. Throughout this book, Ive tried to demonstrate that thereare always plenty of alternatives available to you that dont require that you take on theresponsibility to make others see the light.The recognition that you dont have to change others isnt the same as losing theurge to do so, however. The urge can remain long after you have accepted thesuperiority of direct alternatives. You may often find yourself tempted to intervene inthe affairs of others in order to make things go your way.But as you begin to enjoy the benefits of non-intervention, youll probably findthe urge fading away, slowly but surely. At first it may come only with strangers;youll lose the desire to guide, suggest, change, or alter those who arent immediatelyrelevant to you.Then as this attitude permeates your way of life, the time may come when youllno longer see any point in trying to influence your spouse, your lover, your close friends,your business associates.Youll be so aware that each person must go his own way, in his own way, thatyou wont want the sour fruits of a victory that requires someone else to change hisways. What you get from trying to restrain someones natural impulses is of littlebenefit to you. What you get from a person whose desires naturally benefit you ismagnificent.The BreakthroughAnd so one day you may discover that youve achieved a new freedom, anemotional freedom thats greater than any youve known before  freedom from theurge to control others.When you have that freedom, youll experience a wondrous sense ofweightlessness, an absence of burdens, a freedom to let the world unfold as it will adventurously, challengingly. Youll know that whatever happens isnt your problembecause you no longer have the responsibility to see that others do what they should.This freedom has been completely mine only for a year or two  so its still newand awesome to me. I doubt that I could ever put into words the effect it has had upon mylife. I know that it makes me feel lighter than air; Im relieved of all the burdens that comefrom feeling that someone else must act in a way I want.Even when the actions of others affect me directly, I know that there are manyalternatives available to me; I dont have to feel that someone must act in276Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldone prescribed way. I can let each person be himself, do as he chooses, learn what hewants to learn, go where he wants to go. I have no duty to restrain him. What arelief!Does a friend become angry with me because of something Ive said or done? Ican explain my position  in case he wants to understand. But I dont have toconvince him of anything. There are always new, and probably more appropriate,friends.Are there people who are polluting the atmosphere? Let them. There are plenty ofways I can make sure that doesnt affect me.Do the politicians want to impose new restrictions? Let them. Ill find ways ofavoiding them easily enough. I couldnt stop the restrictions anyway  and I have nourge to waste my precious time trying. I have no temptation to vote, to campaign, totry to stop a candidate who promises new follies. If hes elected, hell probably dojust what his opponent would have done  which means whatever he has to do toconsolidate his power.Im free!  free of that awesome responsibility that once commanded me to worryabout everything, that once caused me to continually try to make others see what Iunderstand, that once made the actions of others my responsibility and concern.Have I retired to a cave somewhere to live as a hermit? Obviously not.It doesnt even mean that Im continually switching friendships. Nearly all thefriends Ive made in the past nine years are still my friends  no matter how little or howmuch contact there may be between us.Nor does it mean that I could never find a lifetime love relationship. It only meansthat I dont have to feel that any given romance (new or existing) must be made to lastforever. Im free to let my lover be totally free.Nor does it mean that I never speak my mind about a difference of opinion withsomeone. Im quite willing to state my view to persons who are important to me. ButIm not trying to change anyone. I use my view as a suggestion  a way to find outmore about him, where he stands, and whether hes responsive to my thoughts.If he finds my alternative attractive, it may provide a new opportunity for me. ButIm not dependent upon his acceptance; Im fully prepared to go elsewhere, ifnecessary. I have everything to gain and nothing to lose except the small amount oftime necessary to present the suggestion.I feel this way whether the situation involves a personal relationship or a businessproposition. Even when selling for a living, I never felt dependent upon any givenprospect; I never felt that I had to convince anyone of anything. And that attitude hasresulted in far more success and far less frustration than most people get when theyfeel they must be persuasive to get what they want.Freedom in an Unfree World277When I lost the urge to control others, I also lost all need to hate or fear anyone.The world is no longer divided between the good guys and the bad guys. Now I can seethat each person is seeking his own happiness, each in his own way (just as I am), and thatthere are some people with whom I have a conflict of interest.But I dont have to hate or fear anyone. Those emotions come from a sense ofvulnerability  from the feeling that someone has to act in a certain way to pleaseyou. When he doesnt, and youve depended upon him (or depended upon your ability tomake him be as you want), you can easily respond with hate or fear. But when yourewilling to let each person go his own way, you lose all need to hate anyone.Neither do I have to worry whether anyone is getting away with anything. Imnot the worlds policeman. I know that everyone will experience the consequences ofhis own acts. If his acts are right, hell get good consequences; if theyre not, hellsuffer for it. The consequences are the only standard that matters  and Im certainlynot needed to impose those consequences.It isnt my concern to see that justice prevails; it automatically prevails  uponme and everyone else. Justice is the natural, inevitable consequence that followsevery act. Any attempt to interfere with that natural justice will just bring aboutadditional consequences that I might not like for myself.So there is no reason for me to be concerned about anyone elses business except as I decide how I will deal with that which affects me.When you achieve freedom from the urge to control others, your life is truly yourown  to make of it almost anything you might want. For youre no longer burdened bythe need to make others understand; your time is no longer regulated by plans thatdepend upon your persuasive powers or your ability to dominate situations.Youre free  free to choose among thousands of direct alternatives  free tochoose the ones that can make you happiest.I dont think you can really be free until youre willing to let others be free. Onlythen are you relieved of that terrible responsibility for the way others act.Then you can expose yourself as you really are, because you neednt beacceptable to any particular individuals. You can let the appropriate individuals cometo you because of what you are  and you can disregard those who reject you.This book is an example of that attitude. It should be obvious by now that I didntwrite it in hopes of changing the world. I hope only to offer more ideas, moreencouragement, and more alternatives to those who are receptive. My relationshipswith such people are mutually beneficial. I trade ideas for money 278Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldbut I would never make my future dependent upon changing or controlling orpersuading anyone.There are many people to whom those ideas are important  and those peopleare the primary reason Ive written this book. Im letting those people know thattheyre not alone, that they have every reason to follow their own minds  regardlessof the views of those around them.Too, the book is a part of my personal advertising campaign  revealing what Iam to those who would approve.I know that there are plenty of people who see life in a way similar to mine. Ivemet many of them  and I know there must be many more. My life has been enrichedby such people; their presence has brought me thousands of days of stimulation,excitement, and happiness.With so many wonderful people alive, why should I focus on those with whom Ihave conflicts of interest? Why should I try to rally the kindred souls into a fruitlesscrusade to change the world? The world is already too beautiful, so full of wonderfulopportunities that I couldnt possibly take advantage of all those already available tome. Why must I make the world better?The Ultimate FreedomFreedom from the urge to control others has made my life more exciting than Icould have imagined it could be nine years ago. But beyond that, theres a furtherfreedom that I seek, a freedom that can come only after losing the urge to controlothers.At that point, one is free to let himself be free; hes free to discover himself moreintensely. He no longer needs to conform to any preconceived standard. Hes free tolet himself develop as his real nature dictates.This, of course, means getting completely and permanently out of the IdentityTrap.It doesnt happen all at once, however; it develops in stages. There are constantdiscoveries to be made about oneself; theres no clear dividing line between beingoneself and trying to be something other than oneself.You come to a point where you take yourself more and more seriously and beginto accept more and more of what you see in yourself. And then you come to anotherpoint where you feel youve never really seen yourself clearly before. And anotherpoint and another. You continually achieve new levels of awareness of yourself.I call this freedom from the urge to change yourself. I dont feel Ive fully earnedthis freedom, so theres little more I can say about it. But I know thatFreedom in an Unfree World279every step closer to it provides its own benefits. As with the other freedoms, itdoesnt have to be achieved in toto in order to be rewarding.Every day Im more and more willing to accept myself as I am; I regard my natureas a given fact and then work to satisfy myself as I am.I cant say whether I will ever completely lose the urge to control my own nature.I know only that everything I do to move closer to that goal is of great benefit to me.And I know how valuable it has been to me to lose the urge to control others  so Iexpect to continue to benefit as I become less inclined to control myself.The FutureWhere you go with these ideas will be up to you. Wherever you go, it should be fun.Life is an adventure, not a burden.So many people spend so much of their lives trying to unravel the mysteries of theuniverse, trying to understand the meaning and purpose of such things as wars,poverty, misery, complications, and boxes.Others try to gain the upper hand over life through religion, astrology, ESP,positive thinking, or drugs. Why? All they need to do is open their eyes and seewhats in front of them  a beautiful world with every opportunity for freedom andhappiness.If others choose to make the worlds ills their business, let them. If others chooseto fight the politicians wars, its unfortunate but thats their choice. It doesnt haveto be yours.You can make a wonderful life for yourself; you have everything you need to do it.Let others fight their campaigns for themselves. Dont forfeit the only life you have;use it to make living everything youve ever wanted it to be.Use the years ahead of you to advance the only really important cause that exists your freedom and happiness. You can have it if you concentrate on yourself andwhat you need for happiness  instead of worrying about what others think and do.You are the ruler of your world and no one can dethrone you  unlessyou choose to let him. No one can stop you from living as you want tolive  unless you disregard your own sovereignty.There is so much you can have  and it will be yours to keep, to cherish, andenjoy without guilt or insecurity. You wont be depending upon your ability to holdthings together; youll be enjoying what is easily and firmly yours. Youll beinvolved with people who want you to be what you are  and who willenthusiastically give you, without sacrifice, what you want to have.280Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldI cant express how much I appreciate your spending this time with me. I hopethat it has added something useful and beneficial to your knowledge andopportunities.Well probably never meet, but I want you to know that Im on your side. And Iwish you the very best.Live and let live. Friedrich von SchillerFreedom in an Unfree World281Appendices282A.Afterword to the 25th Anniversary EditionThe ideas in this book have served me well for most of my life. Nothing in the past24 years has suggested to me that my basic view of how the world works is incorrect.But every day I discover new insights into how things work  as well as newways to apply the principles that guide me. Im sure you, too, have found this to betrue.Theres no need to cover the changes in my way of applying the principles,because you must apply them in a way that makes sense for your circumstances not for mine. The examples Ive given from my own life are just that  examples.They werent meant to indicate that my way was the only, or even the best, way foreveryone to act.However, I will comment on two areas of my life in which my thinking hasevolved.MarriageThe first is marriage. Since November 2, 1985, I have been married to the formerPamela Lanier Wolfe.The relationship has been enormously satisfying for me, and now I cannot imaginenot being married.One benefit of marriage is that it tells the world that this relationship is differentfrom all others  that this is the person with whom I expect to spend the rest of mylife.And the wedding ceremony can be an event that implants firmly in ones mind,intellectually and emotionally, the importance of the relationship  that the joys oflove and companionship are not trifles.I still think that most people can profit from living together before being married.A relationship is quite different when you arise together, eat most of your mealstogether, and share a residence. A great deal of grief might be prevented by finding outwhats really in store before getting married.283GovernmentThe second area is in dealing with the government.It has become progressively harder to elude the tax laws and regulations imposed bygovernments at all levels  governments that continue to get bigger, more expensive, andmore intrusive.So it may not be as easy to ignore the government as it was when this book was firstwritten.However, it still is important not to simply accept whatever rules the governmentdictates. No matter what happens, youre smarter than the government. Youre moreflexible than the government. And you have more incentive to make your life work wellthan government employees have to make government work well  or even to make itwork at all.Continue to look for ways to circumvent the dictates of the politicians, but do it onyour own. Dont join a group of tax-resisters; merely look for safe ways to reduce yourown taxes as much as possible.As government has become bigger and more unwieldy, more and more people havelearned that government delivers very little of value. Polls indicate that two thirds to threefourths of Americans believe government is far too big and does more harm than good.The publics attitude toward government is far more skeptical than when I wrote thisbook in the early 1970s.Those who vote (a dwindling minority of the population) continue to electpoliticians who make government larger, because so few candidates can be trusted todo anything to make government smaller. The claim that voters prefer security tofreedom is false. Voters have never been given a choice  a chance to give up thesecurity provided by government in exchange for freedom from the income tax andother burdens.I believe theres a good chance today that most Americans can be roused todemand a large-scale reduction in the federal government  if they are offered a clearpath from where we are now to much smaller government, much lower taxes, andmuch less government control of their lives.This inspired me to run for President in 1996 as the candidate of the LibertarianParty.My decision wasnt contrary to anything I wrote in this book. I ran because I wantedto, and I enjoyed it immensely. I may even do it again in the year 2000.Trying to change the country as a way of changing my relationship to governmentis what Ive called an indirect alternative  one that depends for success upondecisions made by others. But I saw my task as little different from a business executivewho attempts to turn an ailing company around by284Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree Worldmotivating its employees. I saw an opportunity, and the challenge was too enticing topass up.The campaign also may seem to be an example of the Group Trap  a situation inwhich your success depends on the efforts of other people. But success wasntdependent on winning the election. I ran to please myself, and I encouraged others toparticipate only if they would enjoy the experience. Fortunately, most libertarians arentprone to self-sacrifice.I have had a very exciting life  living six years in Switzerland and five years inCanada, seeing my books on the national best-seller lists, including one that reached #1,watching my expectations for runaway gold and silver prices come true in the 1970s,traveling, meeting celebrities, living well. But the most exciting two years of my life werethose I spent running for President.I traveled to 37 states, appeared on over 500 talk-radio shows, spoke beforegroups all over America. I was encouraged to find that most Americans are fed upwith big government.I continue to believe, as I said in the government chapters, that no one has anobligation to vote or to try to change society. But I was glad to find that so manypeople wanted to be a part of my Presidential campaign.You have to decide for yourself whether to participate in any group endeavor. Andone thing to weigh is whether you will consider your participation to have beenworthwhile even if the group doesnt achieve its main objective.No one can predict whether the effort to reverse the trend to big government willsucceed. But anti-government sentiment has grown so strong that I now think itspossible for someone who can rally that sentiment to be elected President. The oddsmay be against us, but it no longer seems impossible.However, it seems obvious that such an endeavor will never succeed through theRepublican or Democratic parties  as demonstrated by the candidates theynominated in 1996. Success will require a strong third party  one whose overridingpurpose is to reduce government. The only realistic possibility I see for that role is theLibertarian Party  whose members are united by a desire for individual liberty,personal responsibility, and freedom from government on all issues at all times.If the Libertarian Party succeeds in becoming a strong force in American politics, itmay eventually become as corrupted as the old parties. But, until then, it provides arefreshing alternative. And so I have chosen to do what I can to help build the party asrapidly as possible.2525If you want to know more about this, call the Libertarian Party for information at (800)ELECT-US or visit their web site.

Bookmark not defined.Apart from the prospect ofelectoral success, the party offers many benefits  including the opportunity to meet peoplewhose attitudes toward life and freedom may be similar to yours.Afterward to the 25th Anniversary Edition285Your LifeIf youve enjoyed this book, its probably because you and I see the world in similarterms. The book has been useful because it extends what you already knew to logicalconclusions that make sense to you.But you and I are not the same person. Our understanding and knowledge mayoverlap, but they wont coincide exactly.I enjoy my life because I refuse to model it after the life of anyone else. I refuse toaccept a way of doing things simply because it seems to work for someone else. Irefuse to assume that what has made others happy is certain to make me happy.You will enjoy life to the fullest only if you exercise the same independence from me as well as from the rest of the world. You have the ability to decide foryourself whats right for you, what will work for you, what will make you happy.How do I know that? Because you wouldnt have made it this far through thebook if you couldnt think things out for yourself. If you werent able to make yourown decisions, you would have been too shocked by some of what Ive said to finishthe book. Instead, you were able to overlook our differences and take advantage of theareas where my words could help you.Nothing I decide to do changes that. I choose what is best for me and those closeto me  not for you or for anyone else. And those decisions are based on my nature,my talents, my limitations, my circumstances, my hopes, and my dreams.What I may see differently from 23 years ago is unimportant to you. It doesntaffect the decisions you make. You have to choose whats best for you  no matterwhat I decide to do.Only to the degree you can shake off the pressure of other peoples opinions can youmake decisions that are right for you. Youll profit by being open to the ideas ofothers, but dont let their choices control what you do  unless you are personallyinvolved with them.No matter how big the government gets, no matter how others decide to live, youhave the opportunity to live more freely than most people believe possible.More than anything else, you achieve your freedom by letting others be free, byresisting the urge to control their actions, by releasing them to make their own decisions and then by making your decisions based on whats actually available to you, not onthe circumstances you wish for.286Harry Browne / How I Found Freedom in an Unfree WorldSetting your SightsAs I look back over my life, I can see so many ways in which I could have donethings better than I did, and I certainly wish I'd learned a lot of things sooner than Idid.And yet I have enjoyed a wonderful life. I'm married to the ideal woman, I havehad the good fortune to be associated in business with highly competent, honest,compatible people. I've had a book that was #1 on the best-seller list, and others that soldwell above average. I've had first-class friends in many different areas of my life. I'vebeen able to live in three countries and enjoy the best the world has to offer. I washonored to be the Presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party.To have made so many mistakes, and yet to have had so much. It proves that youdon't have to be perfect to succeed.When I die (if ever), Id like the epitaph on my tombstone to read:I didnt do everything I wanted to do,I didnt become everything I wanted to be,But because I aimed for the stars, I reachedthe top of the world.I don't advise being careless or sloppy. I do advise that you hold fast to yourbeliefs and act in the best way you know how  but then forgive yourself wheneveryou fail to measure up to your standards.You will never be perfect. But you can be free and happy. Ihope you make it.Afterward to the 25th Anniversary Edition287B.AcknowledgmentsIf youve Found the material in this book easy to follow and understand, a largeshare of the credit must go to two free individuals  Donna Rasnake and MarkCorske. They spent hundreds of hours working with me, clarifying the principlesinvolved and editing my words. They understand the concepts very well, and so theirsuggestions were usually very helpful.Our relationship was an excellent example of the use of the principles expressed in thisbook. Since the basic ideas and principles are mine, and since Im responsible foreverything said in the book, we were never involved in Group-Trap decisions. Theyprovided numerous suggestions and examples, but the final decisions always remainedwith me.Consequently, the ideas and writing style are still very much my own. But the clarityof presentation has been greatly improved by their help.In addition, over the past several years, many people have helped me to betterunderstand various principles that have led to the ideas expressed herein.Im particularly grateful for the help Ive received in years past from Alvin Lowiand Marian Hall Landers, and from the writings of Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand.Since there are significant philosophical disagreements between myself and thesepeople, please dont assume that they endorse any specific viewpoints expressed inthis book. There are also others whose past help is appreciated, but whose ideas areso different from mine that they have asked not to be named.Andrew Galambos inspired me to make some of the career changes that greatlyenhanced my life.Dr. F. A. Harper and Stu Sanders made valuable suggestions after reading themanuscript of this book.Im also grateful to The Macmillan Company for its willingness to publishcontroversial ideas, and to my editor, Eleanor Friede, for her encouragement,assistance, and patience.288Perhaps most of all, Jeannette Tromanhauser has been a valuable friend who in 1971encouraged and inspired me by her desire for me to write this book so that she couldread it.To take what there is, and use it, without waiting forever in vain forthe preconceived  to dig deep into the actual and get somethingout of that  this doubtless is the right way to live.
